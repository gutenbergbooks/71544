<h3 id='ch1.1' class='c016'><span class='sc'>Chapter I.</span><br> <br> HOME IN A PARADISE.</h3>

<p class='c017'>The fair and fertile county of Kent has long
suffered peculiarly from the poverty of its labouring
population. To the traveller who merely
passes through it, it looks like a fruitful garden,
capable of affording support to as many inhabitants
as can gather round its neat towns, or
settle on the borders of its orchards, hop-grounds,
and corn-fields; yet it is certain that nowhere,—not
in the alleys of Manchester or the cellars of
London,—is more abject, hopeless poverty to be
found than in some of the country parishes of
Kent. One class murmurs about tithes, and
rages about poor-rates, while another sets law at
defiance, and fills the country with news of murderous
poaching expeditions, and of midnight
fires;—guilty adventures, of which the first brings
in only a precarious and dearly bought advantage,
and the other is the most effectual method that
could be devised for increasing the very evils
under which the people are groaning.</p>

<p class='c001'>Some years ago,—before the first ruffian or
fool of a rick-burner had conceived the bright
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.2'>2</span>idea of destroying food because the people were
starving,—the parish of A——, in Kent, seemed
to some of its inhabitants to be sunk into the
lowest depth of poverty that could be found in a
country like England; though, alas! it has since
been proved that more remained to be endured
by its population than had yet been experienced.
The parish of A—— contained at that time about
two thousand persons; the number of labourers,
including boys, was about 450, of whom upwards
of 300 were of the agricultural class. The
farmers were doing badly, and could not employ
all these people; or, if they employed all, could
not sufficiently pay any. They reckoned that
there were between fifty and sixty able-bodied
men more than were wanted. The burden on
the parish of these men and their wives and families
was very grievous to the poorer class of rate-payers;
and in proportion as it became more
difficult to them to pay, the numbers and the wants
of the paupers increased; and among the whole
body of the population of A—— the effects of
want showed themselves more and more every
day in the spread of recklessness and crime. It
mattered not that in spring the orchards were gay
with the delicate pink of the apple-blossom, or
that flourishing young plantations put forth their
early verdure as if the place had been a paradise;
for there were theft in the woods, and murmurs
of discontent from beneath the hedgerows. It
mattered not that in autumn the hop-pickers were
busy gathering in their fragrant harvest; for too
many of them had fathers, or brothers, or sons,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.3'>3</span>looking on idly from a distance, envious of their
employed companions, and thankless that the
season had been propitious to the ripening of the
delicate crop. It mattered not that the sun
shone on fertile valleys and snug homesteads:
for many a houseless parent scowled upon comforts
which he must not share; many a child
shivered with disease and hunger amidst the noonday
heat. It mattered not even that new dwellings
for the poor were rising up here and there; for
their creation was no sign of prosperity. They
were reared by speculators in pauperism, who
depended on the rents being paid out of the rate.
From this circumstance, it was easy to guess by
what class they would be occupied;—not by such
cottagers as England boasted of a century and
a half ago, but by reckless youths with their
younger wives, who depended on the parish to
help out the insufficient resources of their labour.</p>

<p class='c001'>These new cottages were an eye-sore to some
of the once-prosperous inhabitants of the parish,
who were for ever complaining that the bread
was snatched from their mouths by new comers.
Among the grumblers was Castle; a man who,
without fault of his own, was, in the full vigour of
life, reduced from a state of comfortable independence
to the very verge of pauperism. He had
married early, and proved himself justified in
doing so, having been able, not only to support
the two children of his first marriage, but to fit
them for maintaining themselves by proper training
in their occupations. Frank had served his
apprenticeship to a house-carpenter, and was now
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.4'>4</span>a skilful and industrious workman of one-and-twenty
years of age. His sister Ellen, three
years younger, was a neat-handed dairy-maid,
whom any farmer might be glad to have in his
establishment. That she was out at service, and
that Frank had something to do, however little,
were the chief comforts of poor Castle at this
time; for his own affairs looked dismal enough.
He had married a second time, a woman much
younger than himself, who had never known
hardship, and was little prepared to meet it, however
gay her temper seemed before there was any
thing to try it. She did nothing for her husband
but bring him children and nurse them till they
died, which they almost all did as times grew
worse and comforts became scarce. Only one
little girl, now six years old, remained at home of
all his second family. There were indeed two
lads who called him father, though he had for
some time disowned them as sons. He declared
that Jerry and Bob were born rogues and vagabonds;
and gave a peevish notice to all whom it
might concern that he had cast them off to follow
their evil courses, as they were so given to theft
that it would ruin him to be made answerable for
their misdeeds. Some people thought that fifteen
and sixteen were ages at which some hope
of reformation was yet left; and saw moreover
that the lads had been driven to crime by want,
and prevented from returning by dread of their
parents’ tempers. Castle was now almost invariably
low and peevish; and at five-and-forty
had the querulous tone, wrinkled face, and lagging
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.5'>5</span>gait of an old man. The effect of hardship
had been even worse upon his wife than upon
himself. Instead of being peevish, she seemed
to have lost all feeling; and while her husband
yet worked as long as he could get any thing to
do, she was as lazy as if she had been brought
up to live on parish bread. The only person who
believed that any good remained in her was her
step-daughter Ellen, who never forgot what a
trying change of circumstances she had been exposed
to, and persisted in saying, whenever she
heard her attacked, that a twelvemonth’s health
and prosperity would show her to be a very different
person from what the neighbours supposed.
“Give her help and hope,” she said, “give her
work and something to work for, and her voice
will come down to what it was when she sang
her first baby to sleep; and she will clean up her
room herself, instead of preventing any one doing
it for her. She will go to church again then, and
learn to like Frank as she should do, and not
curse her own poor boys as she does.” Some of
Ellen’s neighbours thought this cant; others
believed her sincere in her hopes of her step-mother;
but all agreed, when the crisis of Castle’s
affairs arrived at last, that, honestly or hypocritically,
Ellen prophesied wrong.</p>

<p class='c001'>News came that Jerry and Bob had been
taken up for robbing and cruelly beating two
young gentlemen whom they had decoyed into a
wood on pretence of birds-nesting; and that, if
not hanged, they would be transported. Castle
declared, though with a quivering lip, that this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.6'>6</span>was what he had always expected. His wife went
further. She hoped they would be hanged, and
put out of the way of being more trouble to any
body. She exhorted her husband to take no steps
on their behalf, but be thankful that he was rid
of them. The neighbours cried “Shame!” and
prevailed with Castle so far as to induce him to
go to the magistrate who had committed the lads,
and swear to their ages; as they were taken by
strangers to be much older than they really were,
and an explanation on this point might procure a
mitigation of punishment. Castle was unwilling
to leave home for two days while his wife was
hourly expecting her confinement; but a woman
who lodged in the same cottage offered to be
with her, on condition of receiving the same attention
from her when she should want it a short
time hence.—Castle was scarcely gone when his
wife had to send for assistance; and before her
child was born, the neighbour who was with her
was in a similar plight. It was the middle of the
night; and the parish surgeon who attended
them had no help at hand, and could not leave
them to call for any. He wrapped up the two
infants in the remains of a blanket, and laid them
beside the fire he had himself lighted. It very
naturally happened that he did not know which
was which of the children, and that he had not
presence of mind to conceal the difficulty. On
taking them up, it was found that one was dead.
His horror was great on perceiving that, instead
of there being any regret on this account, each
mother was anxious to make out that the dead
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.7'>7</span>infant must be her own. Neither of them would
touch the living one<a id='rA'></a><a href='#fA' class='c018'><sup>[A]</sup></a>.</p>

<hr class='c019'>
<div class='footnote' id='fA'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#rA'>A</a>. Fact.</p>
</div>
<hr class='c019'>

<p class='c001'>An unobserved or forgotten witness appeared
in the person of Castle’s little daughter Susan,
who had crept out from her dark corner to peep
at the babes in the blanket.</p>

<p class='c001'>“That is the one you wrapped up first, Sir,”
she said, pointing to the living infant.</p>

<p class='c001'>“How do you know, my dear?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“She knows well enough,” said the neighbour;
“she had nothing to do but to watch.
She——”</p>

<p class='c001'>“How do you know, my dear?” persisted the
surgeon.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Because this corner of the blanket fell under
the grate, and got all black; and when you
brought the other baby you wrapped it up in the
black part. Look!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“’Tis all true,” said Castle’s wife, “and her
child was born first.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The surgeon set her right, and considered the
matter decided; but it was far from being so.
She scolded her little daughter for her testimony
till the child slunk out of the room; she
pushed the infant roughly from her, and cursed
it for its cries. Her neighbour insultingly told
her it was certainly sent to make up to her for
one of the lads that was going to be hanged, and
that it was only a pity she had not had twins.
Words, dreadful to hear from a mother’s lips,
followed. The contention grew louder and more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.8'>8</span>violent, till the surgeon, fearing for their lives
and senses, and being unable any longer to bear
a scene so unnatural and horrible, left the room,
bearing with him the innocent cause of dispute.
Little Susan was on the stairs, still sobbing and
afraid to go in; so she was also taken home by
the surgeon, when he had sent in a neighbour to
tend his two patients.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Here, my dear,” said he to his wife, on entering
his own door, “put this child to bed somewhere,
and try if you can contrive to keep the
infant alive till we can send it to the workhouse
in the morning.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“What has agitated you so much? Whose
children are these?”</p>

<p class='c001'>”The children of Providence only, my dear;
for the hearts of parents are turned against their
own offspring in these days.—What have I seen!
I have seen the contention of mothers for a dead
child. I have been with mothers who would
thank any Solomon that should order the living
child to be cut in two. Solomon himself could
not read mothers’ hearts in these days.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“We will not be hard upon them,” said his
wife. “It is want that has done this;—want
like that which made a mother of Solomon’s
nation devour her own child. We will not blame
them. Would we could help them!”</p>

<p class='c001'>The matter ended in the infant’s being received
into the workhouse, little Susan’s testimony,
though strong, not being so conclusive as to
justify the surgeon’s swearing to the parentage of
the child; and there was no one else who could.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.9'>9</span>When Castle returned, he observed that it signified
little, as the parish must at all events have
maintained the babe; neither he nor his neighbours
could keep out of the workhouse much
longer. This was soon found to be too true,
when Ellen came home, being obliged to give up
her place to a parish girl, and Frank appeared,
with a grave face, to say that he was out of work,
and had been so for so long a time, that he was
convinced nothing was to be done but to go and
seek his fortune elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c001'>Many were the consultations between himself
and his sister as to where he should go. There
was but little chance of being better off in England.
He mentioned Canada; he rather inclined
to the Swan-river settlement; but when news
came that Jerry and Bob were sentenced to
transportation, the idea struck the brother and
sister at once that the whole family might follow,
and by settling near the convicts, keep an eye
upon them, and possibly recover them when they
should be removed from the temptations which
had proved too strong for them. Frank had
heard much of the advantages of emigrating to
New South Wales and Van Diemen’s Land; and
it appeared to him that no family was ever in
circumstances that made the experiment less
perilous than his own at this time. While Ellen
took upon herself to mention the scheme to her
father, Frank went to the curate of the parish,
Mr. Jackson, whom he knew to have been employed
in forwarding the emigration of some
pauper labourers from the neighbourhood; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.10'>10</span>from this gentleman he learned much of what he
wanted to know.</p>

<p class='c001'>It was to Van Diemen’s Land that Mr. Jackson
had assisted in sending out some of his parishioners;
and thither he advised Frank to go
with his family, as there was a great demand for
labour, both agricultural and mechanical, and as
it would be the best situation for Ellen, from the
great scarcity of female servants, especially dairy-women.
It seemed very possible that interest
might be made to get their brothers sent to the
same place, as there were many convicts there
already, and more were wanted as farm-servants.
As to how the means of conveyance were to be
raised,—the common method, Mr. Jackson said,
was for labourers to bind themselves for five or
seven years to some settler in the colony, at a
certain rate of wages, from which the expenses
of the passage, and of food, clothing and habitation
for the term of years, were to be deducted.
Castle and his wife might thus bind themselves,
the one as a farm, the other as a domestic servant
in a family; and Frank’s mechanical skill might
enable him to make very good terms in the same
sort of agreement. For Ellen, a better way still
was open, if she could fortunately get included
in the number of young women who were to be
sent out by government from time to time, to
supply the great want of female population in the
Australian colonies. Mr. Jackson lent Frank
books which informed him of the state and prospects
of the country whither he wished to go, and
several papers issued by government which explained
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.11'>11</span>the terms under which emigration was
authorized by them. Frank found that the sum
of money necessary to be raised was somewhat
larger than he had supposed, but that the means
of repayment were certain and easy. If Ellen
could obtain a certificate from the clergyman of
her parish, that she was between the ages of
eighteen and thirty, that her health and character
were good, and that half the expense of her
passage, namely, 8l., could be advanced by her
parents, or friends, or the parish, she might stand
her chance of being chosen by the government to
be sent out under safe guardianship, and <a id='corr11.13'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='immedidiately'>immediately</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_11.13'><ins class='correction'>immediately</ins></a></span>
placed in a service on her arrival in the
colony. There would be no impediment to her
marrying as soon as she chose to do so; for
which there were only too many opportunities from
the circumstance of there being a very small
proportion of women in the colony. If the
parish could be prevailed on to advance the necessary
sum for the conveyance of the rest of the
family, it seemed that the prospects of all would
become far better than they could ever grow at
home,—better than Frank had dared to imagine
since his childhood. It seemed so clearly the
interest of the parish to favour the plan, that
Frank returned to the consultation with Mr.
Jackson, full of hope that a way was opening for
finding, in a new country, those due rewards of
labour which his native land seemed no longer in
a condition to afford.</p>

<p class='c001'>“What says your father to your scheme?”
inquired Mr. Jackson in the first place.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1.12'>12</span>“Very much what he says to all schemes, Sir.
He likes nothing that is proposed, and fears every
new plan. But as he dislikes and fears becoming
dependent on the parish more than any thing else,
I have great hopes that he will consent to go, if,
after further consideration, I view the matter as
I do now. We will do nothing hastily; but I
certainly feel at present as if redemption was
offered from a bondage which wears the soul and
sickens the heart of man. There’s my poor
father——”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Stay, stay, Frank. What do you mean by
bondage?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“The bondage of poverty, Sir; of hopeless,
grinding poverty. What bondage cows a man’s
spirit more? What sours and debases and goads
him more than to work and work from year to
year in vain? If it was a curse upon Adam to
get bread by the sweat of his brow, what is it
to give the sweat of one’s brow and get no
<a id='corr12.21'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='bread?’'>bread?”</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_12.21'><ins class='correction'>bread?”</ins></a></span></p>

<p class='c001'>“It is a hardship which ought not to be borne
when a fair way is open to shake it off. I only
checked you in the fear that you might be laying
blame where it is not due. I agree with you as
to the evils of your case, and the remedy you
would seek.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“As to where the blame lies, Sir, our institutions
must share it among them;—as well those in
which the people are concerned, as the government.
It is pretty clear, all the while, that the
people in this parish are more than can be fed;
and so the right way seems to be for some to go
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.13'>13</span>where food abounds; and the sooner they are off,
the better for themselves and those they leave
behind, when once they have settled where to
go.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And who is to go?—for that is a question of
no less importance,” observed Mr. Jackson.
“You would not take all your relations, Frank,
would you?”</p>

<p class='c001'>Frank replied that they were all equally in
want, his grandfather and grandmother as well
as his father.</p>

<p class='c001'>“But those who will help you to go,” continued
Mr. Jackson, “must consider the welfare
of the country as well as yours. The parish
must pay more for the passage and maintenance
of your grandfather than he will probably cost
them at home, and this cannot be expected of
them if, for the same sum, they could send over
a young couple, whose labour is wanted abroad,
and whose family will never become burdensome.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Frank saw at once that in sending over a young
couple, the parish sent over also all their descendants,
besides supplying a want in the colony
abroad. After a few moments’ thought, he went
on,—</p>

<p class='c001'>“Surely, Sir, it would relieve the country of
its over-fulness at once, to send out a certain
number of young people every year, as they
become marriageable, instead of spending the
same money in giving a passage to old people?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It would; and the entire effect of emigration,
as a method of relief to the country at large, depends
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.14'>14</span>on the selection of those who are to go.
The number of persons who become marriageable
every year in this country is now 800,000. If
these were sent out, it is plain that the country
would be depopulated in the course of a single
generation; but if we sent out the same number
of old persons, it would make a very small difference
in the amount of people at home; and it
would not be worth the colony’s while to receive
those who would bring little labour and no population.
If, again, we sent out that number of
men and boys to a colony where there are too
few women already, we should afford ourselves
only a half-relief, and give the colony nothing
more than the present labour of these men and
boys; whereas, by sending equal proportions of
men and women, we give the colony all their
descendants as well as themselves, and free ourselves
from the same amount of labour,—which
we do not want.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“A much smaller number than 800,000 would
be enough then, Sir, to thin our population sufficiently?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Certainly. If, instead of sending out people
of all ages, we were to select those who become
marriageable, one-sixth of that number, or about
133,000 persons emigrating annually, would prevent
our population increasing; and this might
be done at an expense not exceeding a fourth of
the sum annually raised for poor-rate, sending
half to America and half to Australia. This would
be well worth while, even if there were to be no
repayment of expenses; which there might and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.15'>15</span>ought to be from colonies where labour is much
wanted.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I am afraid,” said Frank, “that the parish
will refuse to help my father and mother to emigrate,
if it would answer so much better to send
younger people.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Your father is still in the vigour of life, and
may benefit the colony by twenty years’ active
labour yet; and your step-mother is several years
younger. The parish sends out many less likely
to repay them; but I do think your grandfather
and his old lady are quite out of the question,
even if they wished ever so much to go. But
why should they go where every thing will be
strange and therefore uncomfortable to them, and
where they must, after all, be quite as dependent
as at home? If you mean to maintain them,
you can as well send money to them here as
carry them over at a great expense, to receive it
there; and if you cannot help them, they will be
more forlorn there than living on their own
parish. But you will be able to help them, since
a fourth of your wages is all that the parish will
require from you, and this will very soon pay off
your debt. Ellen’s 8<i>l.</i> will easily be earned; and
when she has worked herself free, she will be
able to help the old folks.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“’Tis when I think of her,” said Frank, “that
I am most eager to get to a place where toil is
not in vain. As often as I hear her laugh, or
watch her going about the house with her light
step and busy pair of hands, I tremble lest I
should see a scowl come over her face by and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.16'>16</span>by, and her gait and actions grow listless, like
so many of the women hereabouts. It must be
owing to want and helplessness that our girls
cannot be merry without being bold; and that
they are so given to idleness which has nothing
of the nature of play in it. I can remember my
step-mother, Sir, just such a pretty, light-hearted
woman as Ellen.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You will see more such if you go to Van
Diemen’s Land. There is toil there, and hardship
too; but the toil is hopeful, and the hardship
not of man’s infliction.—I know you do not
object to toil and hardship of this kind, Frank, or
I should be the last person to encourage you to
go. You must give up English likings as to
food and lodging, and (what is more difficult) as
to ways of doing things. You must bear to be
directed what work you are to do, and how you
are to do it; you must resolve from the beginning
to accommodate yourself to the people and
the place, without thinking and talking too much
about how things are in England.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“All this is easy, Sir, for the sake of plenty
and independence.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I trust you will find it so. But, Frank, there
are other things to be considered, both for your
own sake and Ellen’s. You probably see that
in the present state of the colony, particular
sobriety and discretion are required in all the
young women that go there.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Frank was quite ready to answer for his sister;
and hoped that a settlement with a respectable
husband would soon place her out of reach of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.17'>17</span>temptation. He perceived that he would find it
less easy to marry than he might wish; and this
seemed the greatest drawback to the plan: but,
perhaps, when he should be prosperous enough
to marry, he might send over for a wife, as he
heard some settlers did; or might be fortunate
enough to find one that he would like among the
new emigrants who would be coming over from
time to time.</p>

<p class='c001'>Mr. Jackson advised him not to think much
about this at present, if he really intended to go;
and agreed with him that there appeared still less
chance of his marrying in England, if he continued
to be too conscientious to form such a
pauper marriage as many of his neighbours were
venturing upon.</p>

<p class='c001'>From this day, Frank began tutoring himself
and his sister for the new way of life they hoped
to enter upon. They learned all they could, from
books and persons, about the changes they might
look for out of their own country. They inured
themselves purposely to toil and heat and cold,
and strove to bear with patience the trials of temper
which continually arose. There was only one
thing which they did not try to bear patiently;
and that was, receiving parish-pay. Their father
was as much disgusted at it as themselves; and
this assisted his reconcilement to the emigration
plan. He would not give his children the satisfaction
of saying that he liked it, or hoped any
thing from it; but he vowed he would not stay
where he was; and as there was no other place to
go to, this implied assent. He looked with sullenness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.18'>18</span>on the preparations that were made; but he
did nothing in the way of hinderance; nor did he
contradict his neighbours when they took for
granted that he was going. So Frank and Ellen
considered the matter settled as far as he was concerned;
and rather expected to see him much disappointed
if any thing should occur to overthrow
the plan. His wife seemed utterly indifferent
whether she went or staid, or what became of her;
and the whole business seemed to rest upon the
two young people and their friend, Mr. Jackson.</p>

<hr class='c015'>

<h3 id='ch1.2' class='c020'><span class='sc'>Chapter II.</span><br> <br> HOMES ON THE WASTE.</h3>

<p class='c017'>While the deliberations were going forwards,
some rumours which arose out of them reached
the ears of a very influential gentleman in the
neighbourhood, to whom they were not at all
agreeable. Mr. Fellowes was a young man of
large property, who had just come of age, and
whose kindly disposition and activity of observation
equally inclined him to make the condition
of the surrounding poor one of his first objects of
interest. He had for some time been investigating
their state and its causes, with a view to
doing something for their relief when he should
have the control of his fortune. He had fully
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.19'>19</span>satisfied himself of the evils of the poor-law system,
and that the one thing wanted was an increased
production of food,—an object, in his
belief, very easy of accomplishment. This he
intended to prove by an experiment of his own;
or that which his friends called an experiment,—and
he a demonstration. His plan became known
to Mr. Jackson in due time, as well as to many
others less willing to listen to what he had to say,
and to regard his exertions with the seriousness
and kindness which their importance, and the
benevolence of their motives deserved. It was
with equal good will that these two gentlemen
met at the parsonage-door one day, each having
questions to put to the other.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Pray is it true,” inquired Mr. Fellowes, “that
you are encouraging the Castles and others of
your parishioners to emigrate?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Perfectly true; and I was coming to you to
make a request as to something I wish you to do
as soon as they are gone.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Let us see first whether it is necessary for
them to go. Is it quite settled? Are they past
being persuaded?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Their passage is not taken, but their minds
are made up, and Ellen Castle’s name is sent in
to government.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It may be refused; and in that case there is
time to save them <a id='corr19.29'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='yet.’'>yet.”</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_19.29'><ins class='correction'>yet.”</ins></a></span></p>

<p class='c001'>“Save them from what?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“From what! From the manifold woes of
the emigrant. Is it no evil to leave the country,
and the kindred, and the father’s house? Is it no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.20'>20</span>evil to be severed from old connexions, and
wrenched from all that has been beloved from
birth? Is it no evil to be set down in a wilderness,
where climate, soil, the habits of the people
where there are any, and the solitude where there
are not, are all uncongenial, and whatever happens
is new and strange? Is it no evil to be
banished?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“All these are great evils, I grant: but from
which of them are the Castles likely to suffer so
much as by remaining here? Their country
affords no kindly home for them. They will be
disgraced in the eyes of their kindred by becoming
a public burden; and their father’s house
long ago passed into hands better able to keep it
up than theirs. They leave little behind that
they love; for want has chilled their affections
towards their country, and hardship is fast breeding
hatred to the powers which have not hitherto
succeeded in securing the happiness of the <a id='corr20.20'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='people'>people.</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_20.20'><ins class='correction'>people.</ins></a></span>
As for the rest,—they are going to a fine climate
a fertile soil, and among inhabitants who speak
their language, and are under the same government
with themselves. While they have plenty
and independence before them, and leave only
want and woe behind, I cannot think there is
any cruelty in assisting them to go whither they
wish.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But, Sir, you are assuming that they must
prosper abroad and be destitute at home; whereas
I assert that neither the one nor the other need
be the case. Look at the Swan-river settlement!
There was no end of the praise we heard of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.21'>21</span>climate, and the soil, and the facilities of every
kind; and yet where was there ever a more complete
failure?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Through these very facilities the failure happened,”
replied Mr. Jackson. “Land was so
cheap, and required so little capital to be laid out
on it at first, that every labourer chose to have
land, instead of letting his labour to capitalists.
The consequence was, that capitalists could do
nothing for want of labourers; and by the time
their goods were rotted on the beach, and their
cattle had strayed or died for want of proper care,
the provisions they took out with them were
consumed, the new crops had not come up, and
all were reduced to equal distress. It was because
all would be capitalists at first that all became
labourers,—and very poor labourers, at last.
This need not be the case again; and, in fact, the
Castles hire themselves by contract to capitalists
long settled in the parts they are going to.—And
now tell me why it need not be that these
people should be exposed to want and woe at
home.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Simply because they might be colonized here
instead of abroad. I am sure we have waste
land enough and to spare for all our population.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“As to space, undoubtedly; but what say you
to its quality? Why is it still waste in the midst
of a hungry population, if it is worth being
tilled?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Let us try whether it is not; that is all I
ask. Send the Castles, and twenty other families
to me, and let us see whether corn will not come
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.22'>22</span>up upon well-dug ground, as it has ever done till
now.—Remember that the condition of land
varies under the influences of nature, and that
soil once barren need not remain barren for ever.
Nature works,—more slowly it is true,—but not
less surely than man, in preparing the waste for
his support; and there is always a point of time,
sooner or later, when he may take the work out
of her hands and feed upon the fruits of her ministrations.
Wherever there are furrows, wherever
there are mounds, there is a growth of fertile soil.
Particles of sand are brought by the winds to mix
with decaying herbage. Minute seeds of plants
and the decomposed elements of vegetable substances
float in the atmosphere, are arrested by
the first elevation they come in contact with, and
settle down to enrich the land. The vegetation
which springs up attracts the moisture of the air,
and thus is fertility again promoted. It spreads
and spreads till a desert becomes a field, or in a
condition to be made one. O, you may trust to
nature to provide for man!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I question nothing of what you have said,”
replied Mr. Jackson. “On the contrary, when
I preach of Providence, I use as arguments
whatever processes of co-operation and amelioration
we can distinguish among the workings of
nature, from the counteracting forces by which
the planets are retained in their orbits, to the
method by which the crevice of the rock exchanges,
in due time, its carpet of moss for a crest
of branching oaks. But nature is slow in her
workings; and since the life of man is short, his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.23'>23</span>business is to work with her, not to wait for her.
Every acre of ground may in course of ages become
capable of tillage; but our business meanwhile
is to place our hungry brethren where
nature’s work is forwardest. Among the many
grades of fertility prepared by her, it is our wisdom
to choose the highest. This is what I preach
as the truest gratitude to Providence.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I have rather wondered, I own, at the style
of your preaching lately. It would strike a
stranger as unusual.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I do not preach for strangers, but for my
own flock; and if they are not enlightened
enough to apply abstract principles, I must help
them to do so. I must not only tell them to be
honest, but show that honesty can scarcely
subsist under overwhelming temptations to theft
and fraud. I must not only recommend the
domestic affections, but warn against turning
them to bitterness by rashly incurring the risk of
that destitution under which parents and children
learn to look coldly on each other. I must not
only speak of gratitude to God, but show how it
may be made to spring up by distributing to all
a share of his gifts, instead of being starved out
by want and woe. If, as I believe, it be true that
hardness of the lot brings hardness of the heart,
and that blasphemy is a disease of the spirit-broken,
how can I and other ministers of the
gospel promote its influences so well as by teaching
how to bring about that state of society which
is most congenial to those influences?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yours is a more likely way to gain your object
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.24'>24</span>than theirs who carefully separate the interests
of the other world from those of the
present.—Well! I am about to preach to the
same effect by my actions as you from your
pulpit.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Then, if you would second my doctrines, you
must do the thing I told you I meant to ask of
you. You must take down the cottages inhabited
by those about to emigrate; and it must be done
immediately on their departure, or I shall have to
publish the banns of nobody knows how many
young couples the very next Sunday. Unless
you have inquired into the fact, you will hardly
believe how many marry just because there is a
house ready. We have too many dwellings in
proportion to our food.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I have had thoughts already of removing to
my new farm some cottages that belong to me,
and of buying others from the speculators in our
parish funds, who are far too ready to build in
our neighbourhood. There will be little encouragement
for them to build again when all
the surplus population of the parish is located on
my pauper farm, where no strangers may intermeddle.
You must come and see the ground I
have laid out.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Mr. Jackson readily agreed to go, but had
great doubts about the final results of the scheme.
This seemed to Mr. Fellowes very strange, as
they agreed upon the extent of relief at present
wanted, and upon the capability of this farm to
supply it.</p>

<p class='c001'>“It was you yourself who told me, Jackson,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.25'>25</span>that it is not the whole of the people now distressed
that it is necessary to relieve. It is only
the redundancy that we have to take care of.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Certainly: but it should be so relieved as
not to produce a further redundancy.—We have
among us, as we agree, sixty labourers more
than we want. Of these none actually starve,
and they therefore deprive some others of a portion
of necessaries. It appears accordingly that
three hundred are insufficiently fed and clothed
because there is a redundancy of sixty.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well! my district farm will take off sixty at
once, and more afterwards.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And will therefore produce an immediate
relief, restoring to the remainder of the three
hundred their proper share of necessaries; so
would the emigration of sixty. But mark the
difference three generations hence. Our young
people who emigrate carry their descendants with
them to a land where they are wanted. The descendants
of your pauper cultivators must be
turned out upon society after all, in greater
numbers than you now abstract from it. It will
be well if the grandchildren of your present dependants
have not to emigrate at last, after the
expenditure of much capital that might have been
better employed, and at a much greater ultimate
cost than at present.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You seem to forget, Jackson, that the capital
I am laying out is all to be reproduced, and
that the people on my farm are to work themselves
free. If any reliance is to be placed on
calculations which have been conducted with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.26'>26</span>utmost care, if experience is to be trusted, if I
may believe what I saw last month with my own
eyes in the Belgian colonies (which it is worth a
long journey to see), a good deal more than the
cost of settling my paupers and providing for
them will be raised by their labour upon the
ground. The best of them will in time repay me,
and go out with money in their pockets to make
room for others.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And where are they to go? To carry more
labour and new families into a market which is
already overstocked. How much easier to remove
them at once to a labour market where
they and their children will be permanently welcome!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I am for ever met with objections about
raising rents and overstocking the labour-market,”
cried Mr. Fellowes—“I that take no rent, and
bind myself to employ all the labour!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I said nothing about rent,” replied the clergyman.
“I am quite aware that a farm like yours,
made out of a forced application of capital, bears
no relation to the natural process of rent. But I
do not see how you can escape the charge of
ultimately obliging a portion of society to pay too
dear for their food.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“What can you mean, when the very essence
of my plan is——”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Tell me your plan, and then I will tell you
my meaning.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“My plan is to show, on a small scale, how
the charity-funds of this country might be employed
productively, and therefore so as to fulfil
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.27'>27</span>the ends of charity. I would have the unappropriated
wastes of Great Britain, amounting to,
some say, 15,000,000 of acres, (and some say
much more,) set apart to be the People’s Farm.
It should be cultivated by means of public funds,
say our present poor-rates; and it should be so
portioned out as that every pauper should have
the interest of private property in his allotment.—The
further internal arrangements should be made
according to the judgment of the directors.
Mine are to be as like as I can make them to
those adopted in the pauper farms in the Netherlands.
Each family shall have its portion of
ground and its cottage, with food and clothing
till these can be procured by themselves. The
soil shall be improved to the utmost by spade-husbandry,
and by preparations of manure requiring
more labour than can be devoted to the
object in a general way. The productiveness of
the ground being usually very great under these
methods, I expect a considerable surplus every
harvest; of which a part will go to repay the
original expenses, and a part to set forward the
family when they re-enter the world. Meanwhile,
the women and children will spin and
weave, and we shall produce within our own
bounds all that we want. We shall not even
need money: for the people will pay one another
in commodities.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“That is, you are about to carry back a portion
of society to a primitive condition;—to
delving, and a state of barter. If there was no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.28'>28</span>choice between the starvation of a number and this
state of society, I might be brought to look upon
it with some degree of complacency: but when
other ways are open,—when the question is,—not
whether all shall relapse into barbarism or
some starve,—but whether multitudes shall pass
their lives in unassisted digging at home, or a
few wander to distant parts of this fair earth to
leave the many in possession of the blessings of
advanced civilization,—I am for applying labour
to its highest purposes, and for elevating instead
of depressing the pursuits of society. No one
doubts that if every hand was employed in tillage
there would be food enough for all: the question
is whether it be not thus obtained at too great a
cost,—every higher pursuit being sacrificed to it.
Only convey to fertile regions abroad the half of
those who are eager to go, and there will be
abundance of food for all,—and of many more
things equally essential to the full enjoyment of
life. If the Greeks had not done so, what would
have become of all that they did to enlighten and
bless the world? If they had fed their surplus
numbers by employing more and more in tillage
at home, as their numbers increased and the produce
required was greater, there would now have
been little of the philosophy, the literature, the
fine arts, which have spread from their country
over the world; while, after all, fewer would have
lived, and fewer of the living would have been
fed than under their system of emigration.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“They seem indeed never to have thought of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.29'>29</span>the more obvious mode of providing for the people.
Away they sent them, as fast as they
overflowed their bounds.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Because they were so circumstanced as to
perceive at once the fallacy of the supposed remedies
which you and other benevolent persons
here are advocating. The great body of the people
among the Greeks were slaves, maintained by
masters, and not, as with us, free labourers supported
by their own toil. The deficiency of food
was there first felt by the masters, in the cost of
supporting their slaves. Here, it is felt mainly
by the labourers in the fall of the real value of
wages. In Greece, there was no dispute about
the fact, from the moment that food became
deficient. Here, such a deficiency is even now
questioned by multitudes who declare that we
have not a redundant, but only a poor population;
that nobody wants food who has enough to give
for it; and that therefore it is money, or work that
is wanted, and not food. Such observers give
alms, or pay their poor neighbours for digging
holes and filling them up again, or doing things
equally useless; never dreaming that all the
while they are taking food from somebody who
has earned it by a better kind of toil. Such
follies as this could never be suggested by the
state of things in Greece; and I see no reason
why, because our lower orders are not slaves, we
should not abjure our errors, and adopt such
parts of the Grecian policy as were wise.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, but, the long and short of the matter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.30'>30</span>is this. If the quantity of food in Great Britain
is too small, cannot it be increased?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“To be sure it can. If ten thousand individuals
can live this year only by taking a portion from
their neighbours, we may raise as much food in
addition next year as may feed ten thousand
people; but if the people at the same time increase
still faster, how are we better off than we were
before?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But cannot we raise enough that year for
twenty thousand people instead of ten thousand,
to meet the difficulty? The People’s Farm would
admit of this.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It would: but here the question recurs,
whether it will not answer better to send the
ten or twenty thousand people where they
may obtain food at much less cost of toil and
capital, and where their descendants will not
be liable to tax the mother country for food for
generations yet unborn. At home it is only by
a considerable sacrifice that the growth of food
can be made for any length of time to equal,—or
by any extraordinary effort to outstrip the demands
upon it; while, abroad, it spontaneously
keeps ahead of population, and will do so in
many parts, till men have grown wise enough to
regulate population. Our best present policy,
then, is to send our surplus numbers abroad to
eat and prosper, instead of obliging more and
more of our multitudes to dig at home. It is on
your wish to make them do so much labour for
a lesser instead of a greater production, that I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.31'>31</span>founded my charge of your ultimately making
a part of society pay too dear for their food.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You mean because labour is the price of
<a id='corr31.4'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='food?’'>food?”</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_31.4'><ins class='correction'>food?”</ins></a></span></p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes; and food would be almost as much too
dear under your system as under the present.
At present, the competition for food is so excessive
that men bid their labour against each
other to desperation. Under your pauper-farm
system, the same thing would take place in time;
and in the meanwhile, every bushel of wheat would
cost twice or thrice as much labour as in Van
Diemen’s Land; so that both immediately and
ultimately, you oblige a certain number to pay
higher for their food than they need do and
therefore ought to do.—And this without taking
into consideration the change in the proportion
of capital to population which is caused by emigration,—a
change most beneficial to the mother
country.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And how extensive do you conceive that
change to be? There is very little difference
between the cost of conveying persons to Van
Diemen’s Land, and settling them on a pauper
farm,—too small a difference to warrant such an
expression as yours.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“In addition to this difference, there is all the
increase of production which will take place
abroad, and which is so much gained to the
mother country, since it maintains her people.
Besides this, all that would have been unproductively
consumed by the pauper descendants of
these emigrants may be considered as so much
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.32'>32</span>clear gain to the community. Again,—the
thriving population of our colonies will want
more and more of our manufactures, and will
send us their agricultural produce in exchange;
and I suppose you will not question the advantage
of investing our capital in manufactures, and
receiving wool and wheat of the best quality in
return, instead of laying it out on lands of inferior
fertility at home, while the people scantily
supply themselves with the coarse manufactures
of their own firesides? You will not question the
duty of availing ourselves of the advantages of
division of labour in the case of our greatest need?
Yet you would, by your plan of home colonization,
deprive the people of this reciprocity of
benefits. You would set up new manufactures
instead of a new market for them; and all for
the sake of producing food at a greater cost than
under the emigration system. You are clearly
wrong, Fellowes, depend upon it. What a pity
that you should not turn your zeal and benevolence
and your other resources to the best account!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“The fact is,” replied Fellowes, “that on a
matter of so much importance as this, I am
anxious to go on sure ground. I have heard so
much on good authority of the miseries of emigrants
in Canada and elsewhere, and I have seen
so much with my own eyes of the benefits of
the Home-Colonization system in the Netherlands,
that I am induced to do that which I know
will produce great and immediate good, instead
of that whose consequences I cannot witness or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.33'>33</span>calculate. I want to give our poor neighbours
food; and I dare not run the risk of having them
perish with cold and hunger in the woods before
they can get any.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“If you mix up the abuses of a system with
its principles,—if you take the conduct of a few
ignorant adventurers as an example of what is to
be done by all emigrants,” continued Mr. Jackson,
“I do not wonder at our differing as we do. It
is true that too many of our poor neighbours,
heartsick at their condition here, have wandered
forth with nothing but the clothes on their backs
and a hatchet in their hands, without the guidance
and assistance which are necessary to their very
lives in a new climate and condition of society;
but this folly, and the consequent hardship, have
nothing to do with emigration. It is to preclude
such evils that I would have benefactors like you
demonstrate to the people what is essential to a
successful emigration, and that emigration is
sure to be successful if well conducted. As for
its ultimate results, time will teach them to all;
but you, my dear Sir, with your objects and your
resources, will be inexcusable if you do not endeavour
to anticipate them. It will be unpardonable
in you to adopt a manifestly short-sighted
policy while the philosophy of principles and the
evidence of facts lie open before you.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Fact is enough for me, romantic as many of
my friends think me,” replied Fellowes, smiling.
“The fact will be, as you will witness, if we both
live, that two years hence our sixty superabundant
labourers with their families will have food
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.34'>34</span>without burthening the parish. This is enough
for me.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It will not always be enough. If you should
live to see the multiplied descendants of these
sixty persons either suffering themselves under
pauperism, or displacing an equal number from
the ranks of employed labourers, you may wish
that they had been located where there was room
for all without any arbitrary direction of capital,
or factitious employment of labour. If, in your
old age, you do not witness this, it will be because
others have repaired your mistake by conveying
elsewhere the surplus you have created.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“If we both live ten years, friend, you shall
come and see how I send forth those who once
were paupers, with money in their hands, ready
to establish themselves reputably in society. There
will be nothing in this to make me repent.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“No; your time for repentance will be when
each of these monied men sends two paupers to
your gates;—when you find poverty growing up
round you, which you can relieve,—if at all,—only
by a late emigration. I am sure you will
make your confessions to me honestly, if that
day should ever come.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I will, if you will give me faithful tidings of
the Castles, and the others who are going with
them. Let me hear of all their struggles and
trials, from the outset till the end.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You shall, as far as I know them myself.
Meanwhile, let us help one another where we
agree. Do you be on the watch to lessen the
number of dwellings as much as you can, and I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.35'>35</span>will use my pastoral influence in inducing the
young folks to delay the publication of their
banns till they have secured something besides a
bare shelter to begin with.”</p>

<hr class='c015'>

<h3 id='ch1.3' class='c020'><span class='sc'>Chapter III.</span><br> <br> GOING IN SEARCH OF HOME.</h3>

<p class='c017'>Mr. Jackson’s interest in the subject of emigration
to Van Diemen’s Land first arose out of his
friendship with a gentleman and lady who were
appointed by government to superintend the
selection and preparation of the young women
who were assisted in their settlement in the way
already related. His recommendations were received
with the confidence naturally resulting
from this intimacy; and he had interest to get
arrangements made for Frank’s convict brothers
to be settled near the rest of the family. In
course of time, which seemed very long to impatient
paupers, all was settled. Ellen had a
summons to be in London by a certain day, with
her 8<i>l.</i> in her pocket, and a small sum over for
the purchase of such necessaries in the way of
clothing as should be provided cheap for her by
those who were to receive her, see her safe on
board, and furnish her with a letter to the
governor, stating her family circumstances.</p>

<p class='c001'>Frank and his parents, with a few more labourers
from the parish of A——, were to sail in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.36'>36</span>another ship about the same time, proposals
having been sent before them to Van Diemen’s
Land, to bind themselves to farmers for a term
of years at a certain rate of wages, out of which
the parish was to be repaid for the expenses of
their passage and outfit.</p>

<p class='c001'>The outfit was much less expensive in their
case than in that of settlers in Canada and the
western states of America, both because the
climate of Van Diemen’s Land is more congenial
to English constitutions, and because wearing
apparel and other necessaries are much more
easy to be had there, even if not supplied by
settlers as a portion of the wages of labour.
Frank was furnished with a complete set of tools;
and the family with a stout suit of clothes each.
A stock of plain substantial provisions for six
months was added, and this was all. There
were a few grumblers about the last-mentioned
article. They thought that the parish might, at
parting, treat the people with better cheer than
they had been accustomed to; but the parish
authorities were wiser. They had heard how many
lives had been lost on the passage to America
from the poor Irish, who had been accustomed
to nothing better than potatoes, being fed with
an abundance of more stimulating diet, under
circumstances which prevented their taking their
usual exercise; and when, from having nothing
to do, they were tempted to eat more than they
wanted of good things that they could not get
at home. The nearer the diet on ship-board
resembles that in common use, the better for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.37'>37</span>health of the emigrant; and if he finds himself
less disposed to eat than when at the hard labour
he has been accustomed to, no harm will come
of his temperance.</p>

<p class='c001'>As the day of departure approached, Frank
felt it a positive evil that every thing was done
for himself and his family by the parish, as too
much leisure was left for very unhappy thoughts.
He had no idea till the time came how much
there was to be left behind which even he could
not help regretting. He had indeed no beloved
cottage to quit, no favourite stock to sell off, no
circle of attached friends and neighbours to say
farewell to; but he would fain have had such
regrets as these to bear, for the sake of something
to do at the last. He envied his sister at
her needle, making a gown for her mother when
she had finished her own linen, while he wandered
over the hills that looked towards the sea, or
watched for the postman who was to bring the
final tidings for Ellen, or stood with his arms
folded, silently hearing his father’s murmurs or
his mother’s taunts. He was quite angry with
himself for selfishly wondering what he should
do with the three days that were to pass between
Ellen’s departure and his own, when he ought to
be glad that she would be out of hearing of the
uncomfortable sayings that now met her ears
continually.</p>

<p class='c001'>The hour came when the young people ought
to be setting out to meet the carrier’s cart which
was to convey Ellen to London. When Frank
thought he had waited long enough before the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.38'>38</span>door, he went in to look for her, and found her
with her bonnet on, her bundle by her side, and
little Susan on her knee. Her eyes were running
over with tears; but she smiled when he tapped
her shoulder as a signal that they must go.</p>

<p class='c001'>“It seems like a long parting, just because I
am going a long way,” said she, trying to laugh.
“But if we all go to the same place, and there
are meadows and cows, and the same sort of life
we have been accustomed to, there is little to
mind in going, except Mr. Jackson, to be sure,
and grandfather, and—and——”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Where is father?” asked Frank, distressed
at her sobs; “surely he is not gone out just
now?”</p>

<p class='c001'>Ellen ran to the door to look about for him,
and saw her father leaning against the wall.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Where’s your money?” he asked. <a id='corr38.18'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='You'>“You</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_38.18'><ins class='correction'>“You</ins></a></span>
had need take care of money when you have got
it. All the rest is moonshine, to my thinking.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“There is very bright sunshine where we are
going, if they all say true,” said Ellen; “and
that you will find, father, before a year is over.
You may trust Frank and Mr. Jackson, I am
sure; and so——”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I trust nobody. I have had enough of trusting
people,” cried Castle. “All this is your doing,
remember, both of you; so never cast it up to
me. Go, go. ’Tis getting very late. Where’s
your money, I ask you, child?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Safe, father, sewed into my stays. But,
father, what <em>can</em> happen to us so bad as living
here, as—as—we have done lately?”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1.39'>39</span>“Go, children, go, and leave off talking about
our meeting again at the other side of the world.
If I go to the bottom half-way, Ellen, it will be
none the worse for you, but the better, except
that Frank must go too, and you would not like
that so well.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“O father——!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, one kiss more; and God bless <em>you</em>,
whatever becomes of me!”</p>

<p class='c001'>Ellen found her step-mother gossipping with a
neighbour as if nothing was happening. Her
farewell words were few.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Goodbye. If I find you an honest woman
next time I see you, it’s more than I expect,
from what people say of the place you are going
to. Come, now, Frank, don’t be in a passion.
Better take care of your sister than look so proud
about her.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Frank now took care of his sister so far as to
remove her while she had strength to go.</p>

<p class='c001'>“O Frank!” she cried, as he put her arm
within his own, and led her rapidly on, “what
can there be about me that makes them all talk
as they do?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Nothing about you, dear, but about the
place. It is a dangerous place for vain, silly
girls; but you need only mind your business,
and think of father and mother, and what we
have agreed to do for them, and you will do well
enough.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And of Mr. Jackson, and grandmother, and
how she almost broke my heart last night.
Look, look! do you see how yonder trees stoop
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.40'>40</span>and shiver in the churchyard? What a shower
of leaves!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“’Tis a sudden gust. There have been many
such of late.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Just so they went when Molly Shepherd’s
funeral was going under them, and grandmother
bade me beware of her shame. ’Tis just like a
sign to me now! And here comes Mr. Jackson
too.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Mr. Jackson just stopped her to give her a
little book as a remembrance, and to beg her to
write to her grandfather, of whom he should
inquire for her from time to time. It was now
really very late.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Don’t hurry yourself,” said Frank. “Walk
quick if you like, but don’t be flurried. I’ll
overtake the cart for you, I’ll be bound; and you
had better look like yourself as you get in.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The carrier was just cracking his whip to proceed
after a halt, when the brother and sister
made their appearance at the end of the lane.
Ellen cast one glance back upon the familiar
spire and hedgerows and cottage roofs, and summoned
up one bright smile and a few more words
for Frank.</p>

<p class='c001'>“’Tis not as if you were to stay behind,
Frank.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“To be sure not! Leave every thing to me
dear, and be steady and easy, that’s all; and
don’t talk of Bob and Jerry, for your own sake.—All
right, carrier?—Well then, good bye!”</p>

<p class='c001'>And high on the hedge stood Frank, gazing
long after he had ceased to distinguish the bright
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.41'>41</span>face looking out at the back of the cart. Not till
the vehicle had disappeared behind the hill did
he descend to the stubble-field below, and pick
up straws, and cut hazel switches like a truant
boy, muttering to himself “In three days we
shall be off.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The second departure was more public and
more painful. The two old folks would come
out at the last moment; and their distress moved
the gazers to an outcry against the cruelty of
deserting them, and the unnatural behaviour of
leaving one’s country and kindred. A giddy
young couple thanked the Castles for vacating
their cottage just when others were wanting one;
and of the rest, some who were disappointed of
going looked on in silent envy, and others were
loud in their reports of the dangers of the sea,
and the horrors of savage life. Frank had seated
his charge in the waggon and walked on, intending
to be overtaken out of hearing of these busy
tongues. He looked back from the first corner,
and seeing that there was great confusion, returned.
Castle was motioning away the parish
officers and Mr. Jackson, and doggedly refusing
to go after all. His wife was laughing, and little
Susan crying.</p>

<p class='c001'>“You must please yourself, father,” said he
firmly. “If you put yourself out of the way of
being helped by your own children, God help
you! I must go, and that this moment.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Come along!” cried the wife. “We may
as well get out of reach of these plaguy officers,
with their talk of our debt to them. Let’s be off,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.42'>42</span>and then they may get their money as they can.
We shall never drive our carriage here, as they
say my boys may do at Botany Bay. Come
along!”</p>

<p class='c001'>Frank would allow of no force, His father
should choose for himself. So said Mr. Jackson.</p>

<p class='c001'>While he was choosing, a ready pauper jumped
into his place, and the waggon drove off.
Before it had gone two hundred yards, there was
a cry to the driver to stop, the new candidate was
turned out grumbling, and Castle scrambled in.
Twenty times during the journey to London, he
asked how he and his were to pay the seventy
pounds required to send them out; and as often
his wife bade him not mind whether it was paid
or not; and Frank assured him that he should
not be burdened with debt, if his children lived
and prospered. Tears came at last to the unhappy
man’s relief. As he passed villages and
farmsteads where healthy and cheerful faces
looked up at the waggon as it went by;—as he
heard the saw grinding in the saw-pit, and the
hammering at the forge, he wept at being reminded
of his younger and more prosperous days,
and at the thought that while so many were busy
and happy in their occupations, there was no
room for him,—once as hearty in his toil, and
now as willing to work as any of them. Frank
contrived to gather what was in his thoughts, and
spoke of the saw-pits and forges which are so
busy in the land they were going to, and of the
increased dignity and profit of such occupations
in places where artificers are scarce. His own
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.43'>43</span>heart was ready to sink when he fancied, instead
of such a busy region as that under his eye,
plains and valleys with scarcely a roof visible
from end to end: but every glimpse of a workhouse,
every notice by the way-side about vagrants,
restored his courage, and satisfied him
that it was best, at all events, to be where,
whatever other evils might exist, there was no
pauperism.</p>

<p class='c001'>The departure of Jerry and Bob took place in
a somewhat different style. A stranger would
have fancied there was high holiday in Newgate
the day before they went. Parties of convicts
from the country arrived, and were lodged there
previous to embarkation, and the larger proportion
were full of congratulations to one another
on their fine prospects. This was done in bravado
by some, no doubt; and a few looked
downcast, and were laughed at by their companions
for the shame expressed in their countenances
and manners: but it was actually the
belief of most that they were lucky fellows to be
carried free of expense to a country where they
should have little to do but get rich as fast as they
liked. Two among them had been transported
before, and so wonderful and tempting were the
tales they had to tell, that they not only found
willing listeners among criminals wherever they
went, but had induced more than one of the
present company to commit thefts in order to
get transported and put in fortune’s way. These
men, Giles and Green, held forth in all the vanity
of superior experience, and in all the pride of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.44'>44</span>having cheated the law; and drew an attentive
audience round them while waiting for the cart
which was to convey the company to the convict-ship.</p>

<p class='c001'>Bob was leaning rather despondingly against
the wall, when his brother clapped him on the
shoulder, and asked him why he looked so black
on this the grandest day of his life.</p>

<p class='c001'>“You should have said ‘thank’ee’ to the judge,
Bob, as I did when he finished with us; and so
you would if you’d known how we were obliged
to him. We’ll have each a house and servants,
and all handsome about us by the time we’re one-and-twenty,
and meanwhile, there are fine pranks
to be played. Come and hear Green, about how
he and his set got as much rum in one night as
they could drink in a month, and what frolics
they had in the woods, before he took it into his
head to come back without leave.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Bob shook himself free of his brother, who
however would not long let him alone.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I say, Bob,” he continued, returning, “they
call you sulky; and it will be the worse for you
in the colony if they report you sulky. You may
as well hear what we are to do when we get
there.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Bob listlessly followed, and took his place
among the eager hearers.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Bet Turner!” cried one. “What is that
she that belonged to Greville’s gang? She
that got transported for shop-lifting?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“The same. Well; she has a large white
house just out of Sidney, on the right hand as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.45'>45</span>you go out of Mount-street. Lord! you should
see her driving out, how grand she looks over
her servants, and as well behaved to her husband
as if she had not left another behind her. They
say she sends Turner a bank note every year
out of charity. He has married again to give
her satisfaction that he won’t claim her; so they
are both content.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Then there is Wilson,” cried Green. “You
remember what a poor ragged creature he was
while he worked like other honest men, for nine
shillings a week. He got sent abroad for the
first bad shilling he tried to pass after he joined
us; and all for looking like a bungler at a new
trick. He worked his way up into a farm of his
own in four years, and he has got his wife and
children over, and is very much respected. But
Jack Lawe is the finest fellow of them all. He’s
just past thirty, and he is as rich as a London
banker at sixty.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“What, he that was within an hour of hanging?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Aye. They looked pretty close to him for a
long while; but he is as sharp in his wits as he is
clever at whatever you set him to. He cheated
them all round, and got himself free in six years,
and now you should see him out hunting or betting
at billiards. He is a good-hearted fellow, and does
not scorn old friends. Many’s the nod and word
he has given me from the billiard-room window
at Sidney, when I have been passing, let who
would be there. Everybody is glad of the prosperity
of John Lawe, <a id='corr45.32'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Esq.’'>Esq.”</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_45.32'><ins class='correction'>Esq.”</ins></a></span></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1.46'>46</span>Somebody having made inquiry about the
voyage, Green went on,</p>

<p class='c001'>“O, that’s the worst part of it. It’s horrid
enough, to be sure, to be cooped up for months
on board, and all so solemn and dull, and no
getting out of the way of the clergyman. But
it’s not so bad as it used to be, when they treated
such folks as we like so many wild beasts. They
paid the captain so much a head for the people
embarked, and never asked how many he landed;
so he starved as many as he pleased, and stowed
them so close that scores were stifled by the way.
It was mighty dull work then for those that got
safe; the labour was so hard, and no liberty.
There was little encouragement to go to the
colonies then. But now that they don’t kill one
by inches by the way, it is worth putting up with
the passage, for the chance of making one’s fortune
at the end of it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Particularly for them that have friends in
power to get fine situations for them,” said Jerry
pertly. “Bob and I are going to have good
care taken of us, I hear. But it’s a great plague
that the old ones are going to be spies over us.
It will spoil our sport terribly, unless we can
manage to cut them.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“That’s better than having them whining and
praying after us all the way from here to the
ship, as the old folks mostly do,” said Green.
“When I went before, my father behaved as if
he was following me to the gallows. He knows
better now. He gave me the wink yesterday for
a sharp chap that knew how to take care of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.47'>47</span>myself. He said,—true enough,—that the worst
blunder I ever made was coming back when once
I was well off.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Aye, aye, Green; a certain person knew
how to take care of herself as well as you. She
knew better than to keep herself single five years
for you. ’Tis a fine feather in her cap to have
brought you so far on a fool’s <a id='corr47.8'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='errand.'>errand.”</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_47.8'><ins class='correction'>errand.”</ins></a></span></p>

<p class='c001'>Green tried to conceal his visible passion
under an appearance of indifference, while he
muttered that a better one than he came for
would follow him out very soon, if the judge did
not baulk them of the sentence they meant to
get pronounced upon her.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Here they come, lads!” he cried, interrupting
himself. “All is ready: our carriage at the
door! Put a bold face upon it, boys! Now for
it! Don’t have anything to say to the whiners
at the gate. Curse all spoil-sports! Give them
three cheers, boys! Hurra! hurra! hurra!”</p>

<p class='c001'>And gibing, jeering, laughing, shouting, went
the batch of convicts through a throng of relatives
and former companions, and gazing
strangers; some of whom were pale and weeping,
others signing and winking, and more
gaping in wonder and pleasure at the scene;
speculating upon whether the largest share of
punishment did not rest with those who were left
behind. Bob, and one or two other scowlers,
were almost overlooked in the company of adventurers,
who seemed to be going forth merrily
to cheat the law, and seek their fortunes in a land
of plenty.</p>

</div>

<p class='c017'>Ellen was the first of the family that arrived at
Hobart Town in Van Diemen’s Land. Next
came the convict-ship, which was sent round to
Launceston to disembark its passengers; that
port being nearer the district where the convict
labour was to be employed. When the batch of
parish emigrants arrived, a fortnight afterwards,
Frank found, on application to the proper
government officer, that his sister had landed in
good health, and had received a high character
from the clergyman and his lady who had come
over as superintendents of the expedition; that
Ellen had been forwarded, with a few of her
fellow-passengers, to the district where a service
had been procured for her as dairy-maid on a
settler’s farm; and that care had been taken that
her parents and brother should be indentured to
farmers in the same neighbourhood. So far, all
was well. Frank could learn nothing about his
brothers, except that they were to be landed at
Launceston, and that Launceston was within
thirty miles of the spot where he was to be
located. The officer he was speaking to had
nothing to do with the arrangements respecting
convicts: his business was to take care of emigrant
labourers on their arrival.</p>

<p class='c001'>Castle himself could not help being pleased <a id='corr48.29'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='ta'>at</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_48.29'><ins class='correction'>at</ins></a></span>
the appearance of things at Hobart Town, when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.49'>49</span>he and Frank took a walk, the evening after
their arrival. The only objections he could think
of were, that there were few shops; that it was
not at all likely that the country inland should
be half so civilized as what he saw; and that it
was a thing he had not been used to, to have
Christmas fall at the hottest time of the year, and
the trees green all the winter through. It was
now May; and they told him that winter was
coming on, and yet that the woods would look
as green as now all the time; and that the snow,
if there was any, would not lie more than a
day on any ground but the mountain tops, and a
bleak common here and there. They told him
that for more than three hundred days in the
year the sun would shine all day, and the air be
dry and pure, and seldom too hot or too cold.
All this was what he had not been used to, and
did not know how to believe. His son supposed
that if it came true, he would not object; as one
of the consequences of such a climate is that
English people have much better health, and
live, on the average, a good deal longer at Van
Diemen’s Land than at home. Castle peevishly
laughed at all talk about life and health, when it
was, in his opinion, doubtful whether they might
not be starved to death within three months. His
son left this point to be demonstrated by time
rather than by argument; and meanwhile observed
that there were few signs of starvation
about Hobart Town, in which, besides the government
residence, there are nearly eight hundred
houses, most of which are surrounded with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.50'>50</span>gardens; the dwellings having been originally
built on separate allotments of land, of a quarter
of an acre each. The streets cross at right-angles,
and command fine views of the neighbouring
country, and afford cheering evidences of
the success of the industry which has sought
employment there. A dock-yard is seen on the
river’s brink; and corn-mills, tanneries, breweries,
a hat-manufactory, &#38;c., are conspicuous
in the midst of the town. An amphitheatre of
green hills rises to the westward, the crowning
summit of which is 4000 feet high; and from
these hills descends a fine stream of water, flowing
through the town into the Derwent, which,
with its varying expanse and beautifully wooded
bays and sloping shores, forms the eastern boundary.
This view was little enough like what
Castle had fancied in opposition to all that he
had been told. He was for ever picturing to
himself a region of wild woods, or bleak plains
covered with snow; and he was now as much
surprised at the sight of meadows, hills, dales,
and a thriving town, with a blue sky overhead,
as if he might not have known as much before.
He had complained of his hard lot in being
indentured as a shepherd; and no wonder, while
he thought his flocks were to inhabit a dreary
wilderness; but now that he found he had
nothing to fear from storms and snow-drifts, that
the pastures were excellent, the springs plentiful,
and the sheep as fine as the world can produce,
he began to think he might be worse off in point
of occupation; though he would give nobody the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.51'>51</span>satisfaction of hearing him say so. His wife
was to be a domestic servant in the same farm
where he was shepherd; and even little Susan
was carefully stipulated for; the labour of children
being valuable at almost any age, in a place
where much more assistance is wanted than can
be had.</p>

<p class='c001'>The first part of their journey to the Dairy
Plains, (the district where they were to settle,)
was through the very choicest portion of the
island, both as to beauty and fertility. It is not
surprising that those who first surveyed this tract,
and took it as a fair sample of the island at
large, should have represented Van Diemen’s
Land as a terrestrial paradise, and been suspected
of exaggeration through the favourableness of
their report. The fact is, the island is supposed
to contain about 15,000,000 acres,—one-third of
which is considered arable, another third fit for
sheep-pasture, and the rest unprofitable at present.
The country between Hobart Town and
Launceston consists of green hills and fertile
plains, among which towns and villages and
solitary dwellings are interspersed. Rivers wind
between their wooded banks, and streams flow
down from the high grounds. Excellent macadamized
roads run through the whole district,
and branch off to the growing settlements on
either hand of the main track. It was a great
amusement to Frank to compare whatever he
met with that partook of the civilization of his
own country with whatever looked new and
strange. Before leaving Hobart Town, he had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.52'>52</span>been all the more struck with its printing establishments,
its Mechanics’ Institute, its Book
Society, and schools, from observing the strangeness
of the natural productions that he met at
every step. In the gardens he beheld tea trees
where he had been accustomed to see lilacs and
laburnums; and cotton plants, myrtles, and
geraniums growing as tall as himself, and spreading
out into bushes. The very grass grows
differently;—not stringy in the roots and carpetlike
in the surface, as in England; but in tufts.
Parrots, instead of canaries, were the pets of
young ladies; and the bandicoot was offered for
sale instead of the rabbit. Cockatoos instead of
crows were to be frightened away from the fields
and gardens; and flocks of pigeons among the
stubble looked as much like partridges as pigeons;
only more beautiful,—with their gold-dropped
wings,—than either species in England. On the
road, in like manner, the freestone bridge over
the Jordan, the postman on horseback, the tillage
and inclosures, looked British; but the evergreen
woods, in the midst of which arose the peppermint
tree to a lofty height;—the herds of kangaroos
coming out of their covert into the dewy
plains at sunrise;—the spotted opossums climbing
and descending the forest trees;—the black
swans sailing on the lakes, and uttering cries
like the creaking of an old sign-board;—all
appeared foreign, and scarcely belonging to the
people who had settled among <a id='corr52.31'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='them'>them.</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_52.31'><ins class='correction'>them.</ins></a></span></p>

<p class='c001'>A sight of a yet different character met the
eyes of the travellers near the close of the second
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.53'>53</span>day, when they were drawing near their future
abode in the province called Norfolk Plains, in
the centre of which lay the Dairy Plains, where
Ellen was expecting them. They had for some
time quitted the broad road, and were following a
track along which their waggon proceeded with
tolerable convenience. At last they came to a
point beyond which it had not been carried, and
where a gang of labourers was at work roadmaking;—not
as in England, each man intent
upon his own heap of stones, free in limb and
thoughtful in countenance;—not as in Ireland,
where some are lounging and all are joking;—but
charged with the fetters of felons, and superintended
by an armed taskmaster. As Frank
looked upon these wretches, with their hardened
or woful countenances, he felt indeed that he was
not in England, but in one of her penal settlements,—breathing
the air of one of the places
where her vice and misery are deposited. His
very soul became sick when, as the labourers
turned to stare at the somewhat uncommon sight
of a waggon full of travellers, he met the eyes of
his convict brothers. He hoped that his companions
would not perceive them; but he soon
found that his father did, by his testy complaints
of the jolting of the cart, of cold and heat, and
what not. The unhappy mother looked on her
outcast children with as much curiosity as compassion.
Bob turned away, and stooped to his
work, never looking up till they were out of
sight; but Jerry waved his cap and shouted,
and dared Frank to a wager which of them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.54'>54</span>would first be free to work for themselves:
whether it would take longest to work out his
sentence, or to pay for Frank’s passage and
settlement. This supplied a new theme of complaint
to Castle, who wrought himself up into a
passion about his being a slave, with all his
family. Frank, who hated bondage as much as
any man, thought it could hardly be called
slavery to contract to work for one person for a
certain time, in return for advantages which
could not otherwise be obtained. If disappointed
of these advantages,—of sufficient food, clothing,
shelter, and money wages,—the contract was
void, and no harm done; if not disappointed, the
object was gained. The evil lay, not in their
case as labourers; but as honest men. Felons
ought not to be let off so easily, (because their
labour happened to be more valuable than at
home,) as to make disgrace, for which many of
them did not care, their only punishment; their
worldly circumstances being actually bettered by
their removal to a new colony. It was not that
labourers need be better off than their family
would probably be, four or five years hence; but
that felons ought not to be placed in as good
circumstances as the honest emigrant at the end
of the same period.</p>

<p class='c001'>Frank was not yet aware (as he afterwards
became) that, for want of knowing the rate of
wages at the colonies, emigrants often bind
themselves for a much lower rate than they might
obtain if they went free, or if they were properly
informed of the existing state of things; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.55'>55</span>thus think themselves deceived, and are tempted
to break their contract when they find how matters
stand. This evil is to be referred to the
ignorance of emigrant labourers, quite as much
as to the close economy of the settlers, and
should induce all who have heard of it to obtain
such information before concluding their bargain
as will save them from repentance afterwards,
and guard them against quarrels on this score
with their new masters;—quarrels, which, always
a great evil, are most so in newly settled countries,
where all hands and hearts are wanted to
work together for the common good. As it is,
a British artisan jumps at the offer of a plentiful
subsistence and 2<i>s.</i> a-day besides for five years,
out of which the expenses of his removal are to
be paid; and for this rate he binds himself.
When he gets to his destination, he finds that
this plentiful subsistence, including meat, bread,
beer or spirits, tea, sugar, comfortable clothing,
and a convenient dwelling, costs no more than
2<i>s.</i> a-day, and that, if free, he might earn, being
a good workman, from 7<i>s.</i> to 12<i>s.</i> a-day, or even
15<i>s.</i>, if he be a superior mechanic of a scarce
class. It is mortifying to find that he has sold
himself, however much higher than formerly, for
less than he is worth in his new position; and
<a id='corr55.28'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='yence'>hence</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_55.28'><ins class='correction'>hence</ins></a></span> arise discontents which embitter the first
<a id='corr55.29'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='hears'>years</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_55.29'><ins class='correction'>years</ins></a></span> of his new life, if they do not occasion a
breach of contract. The friends of a rational
plan of emigration should do their utmost to
make known to as many as it may concern, to
what extent labour is wanted in the colonies,—what
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.56'>56</span>is the rate of money wages in each, and
what those money wages will procure. The
official information on these points transmitted
from Van Diemen’s Land in 1827, was, that
common labourers earn 3<i>s.</i> per day; common
mechanics 7<i>s.</i>; better mechanics, from 8<i>s.</i> to
12<i>s.</i>; best ditto, from 12<i>s.</i> to 15<i>s.</i>; and persons
of peculiar qualifications, fitted to superintend
farms or other undertakings, 1<i>l.</i> a-day. Since
that time, wages are understood to have risen.
The price of wheat is 7<i>s.</i> a bushel; meat, 2<i>d.</i> or
3<i>d.</i> per lb.; sugar, from 3<i>d.</i> to 6<i>d.</i>; and tea,
from 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> to 4<i>s.</i> per lb.—No wonder that,
amidst all their gratitude at being well provided
for, many such workmen as Frank are vexed and
mortified to find how much more they might have
made of their labour.</p>

<p class='c001'>Far other feelings, however, than those of
discontent were awakened in Frank by the aspect
of his new abode. It was almost in a state of
nature, his employer, Mr. Stapleton, having preceded
him to take possession only a few days
before: but it was far from being a desolate spot
in the midst of a waste, as settlers’ farms are
wont to be in colonies where the unwise object
is to disperse the inhabitants, instead of bringing
them near to enjoy the advantages of a division
of labour and reciprocity of consumption. The
Dutch government at the Cape of Good Hope
formerly forbade settlers to approach within three
miles of each other; and thus effectually prevented
the full improvement of the land, the
construction of roads, and the opening of a market
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.57'>57</span>for exchanges. Hence the Dutch settlers at
the Cape are to this day deprived of many advantages
of civilized life. They have too much
of whatever they grow, and too little of what
they would fain buy; and are debarred the comforts
of society and mutual help. These evils
are likely to be avoided by the method of disposing
of land now adopted by our government
in Australia; the land being sold on terms which
make it the interest of the settler to improve his
tract, and to take advantage of a neighbourhood
which may relieve him of some of his produce.
Mr. Stapleton, having been obliged to choose his
land carefully, and to pay 9<i>s.</i> an acre for it,
(instead of 6<i>d.</i>, or nothing at all, like some of
the earlier inhabitants,) was not tempted to wander
away into the wilderness, and sit down where
he might happen to like the prospect, or to be
smitten with some new discovery of fish-ponds,
woods, and meadows. He made his choice instead
among the lands of a certain district; and
selected such, as to extent and quality, as would
on the whole best suit his purposes, in conjunction
with the privileges of a neighbourhood.
His land, though not of the very first quality,
was good enough to have fetched 15<i>s.</i> per acre,
if it had lain somewhat more to the north or
east, where the country was rapidly becoming
better peopled; but it stretched towards the
unoccupied districts at the foot of the western
mountains, and was less valuable than if it had
been surrounded by civilization, instead of only
<a id='corr57.33'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='rdboering'>bordering</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_57.33'><ins class='correction'>bordering</ins></a></span> upon it.—It consisted,—not of jungle
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.58'>58</span>and forest ground, where room must be made by
the axe before seed could be sown and sunshine
visit it; but of a lightly timbered and undulating
surface of grass land, wanting only a single
burning to render it fit for the plough, or for a
new growth of pasture. The trees were not of
the nature of copse and thicket; but growing in
clumps a hundred feet apart, and with clear
stems, measuring ninety feet or more to the
lowest branch; thus affording spots for shade
and shelter without interfering with tillage. The
boundaries, where not formed by natural streams,
were fixed by marking the trees; and there was
no immediate need of fences where neither man
nor beast was likely to trespass, and where there
was at present no live stock that could be in
danger of straying. No one was near who could
be tempted to steal; for none were poor. The
wild cattle, which in former days did great mischief
on the grounds of the settler, had long ago
been driven among the mountains, where it was
supposed the race had died out, as none now
appeared. The few oxen and horses that Stapleton
brought with him were kept near the dwelling;
and the rest of the stock was not to follow
till all was in readiness for its reception. A rude
shed had been hastily constructed for shelter,
under a clump of trees; and a few sawn planks
were lying about: by which Frank saw that the
materials of his business were ready for him to
begin upon without delay. Tools and utensils
were stowed away in corners, or heaped under
the trees, till their proper places were provided
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.59'>59</span>for them; and a goodly row of casks and packages
of provision stood in the background.
Frank had believed that his spirit of enterprise
had died within him under the hardships of his
own country; but he now felt it revive in a
moment; and was anything but dismayed at the
prospect of what he had to do in his capacity of
carpenter, before the scene before him could put
on the appearance of a snug and well-managed
farmstead. He saw in fancy the day when a
little hamlet of weather-boarded cottages would
be sending up their blue smoke among those
trees; when cattle-sheds and sheep-pens would
stretch out behind the dwellings, and the busy
forge and creaking timber-wain would drown the
cry of the quail, and scare away the kangaroos
that were now leaping over the plains. He did
not forget to add a very superior workshop and
timber-yard to his picture of his own dwelling;
or to imagine his father looking down from
among his flock on the hills, or Ellen within
sight, going forth in the bright early morning
with her milk-pail.</p>

<p class='c001'>As if to answer to his thought, Ellen now appeared.
She had stolen half an hour to run in
search of Mr. Stapleton, to ask once more how
soon he thought Frank might possibly arrive.
Mr. Stapleton was almost as eager for the event
as herself; but he knew no more, and was just
dismissing her, disappointed, when the waggon
was heard approaching. While she waited a moment,
straining her sight to make out whether it
was the right party, before she ran to meet them,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.60'>60</span>her brother jumped out, and even Castle started
up with more alacrity than he had shown since
they landed. Before they could well greet one
another, Stapleton came up to ask where Frank’s
tools were, and to tell him that he was wanted
very much indeed. He could not refuse him
permission to go forward one mile, in order to
deposit Castle and his wife at their new abode;
but he lent a hand towards emptying the waggon
of his workman’s packages, and gave him notice
that he should be glad to see him back the first
possible moment.</p>

<p class='c001'>“You will soon find what great people such
as we are here,” said Ellen, laughing. “This is
the place to grow proud in. No more lounging
about the fields, Frank; no more leaning over
gates chewing straws, while nobody inquires for
one. You will never need to touch your hat and
ask for work here; people will come begging
you to be so very kind as to put up a door for any
pay you please. This is the place to grow proud
in.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Frank observed, with a grave smile, that pride
was dangerous to one in Ellen’s place.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, then, I will be proud of you, and you
shall be proud of me; and no harm can come of
that.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The first time that the brother and sister could
obtain a few minutes’ conversation without being
overheard, Frank inquired,</p>

<p class='c001'>“Now, Ellen, tell me straight forward. How
do you like your change?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Why, I more than half like it; but there are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.61'>61</span>some things I do not like.—It is a fine thing to
be so well off, and to know that I shall be so:
and I do not mind the work, though it is rather
hard, to be sure; and my cows are nothing but a
credit to me, and I have seen no animals to be
afraid of when I go out milking, though some of
them leap about very strangely indeed; and my
mistress makes much of me, as I told you; and
her little worries are not much to be wondered at
when one thinks of the confusion we live in just
now; and I dare say there will be an end of
them when we get our soap and candles made out
of the house, and another hand or two to help in
the brewing and washing. And then to think
that father and you are so well off——”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But tell me what there is that you do not
like.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Ellen almost shuddered when she whispered
that her fellow servant, who ate at the same table,
and slept in the same room, and was her companion
almost all day, was a convict, and had
been sent to this country for robbing an aged
mistress who had confided in her, and deserved
gratitude instead of treachery from her. To be
compelled to hold daily and hourly intercourse
with such a person was a very great evil, and one
which doubled Frank’s anxiety about his sister.
He was glad to hear that there was a probability
of the woman marrying as soon as she could obtain
a remission of her servitude by steady conduct.</p>

<p class='c001'>A half smile which he perceived on Ellen’s lips
when this part of the story was being told, made
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.62'>62</span>him question her further respecting the evils of
her situation, or the trials which she might not
be disposed to consider exactly as evils. The
idea in her mind was that which he suspected,—that
she might quit her service before her convict
companion.—Frank looked graver than ever.
Who—what—where was he,—the person that
seemed to have made advances in Ellen’s good
graces already? She was eager to explain that
there was no one in particular yet. It was too
early for her to have looked about and settled
her mind yet;—but there was this one, and that
one, and the other one, that carried her pail for her,
morning and evening, however busy he might be;
or was ready to teach her how to clean and card
wool; or showed her what a pretty little homestead
he was about to have in the neighbourhood,
and intimated how happy she might be as the
mistress of it.</p>

<p class='c001'>“They hinder my work sadly, and their own
too,” continued she, blushing, “for all I tell them
that I have nothing to say to any body yet. I
am so afraid any of them should have been convicts,
(though I am sure Harry Moore never
was;) and I dare not ask mistress any thing about
<a id='corr62.26'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='them.’'>them.”</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_62.26'><ins class='correction'>them.”</ins></a></span></p>

<p class='c001'>“Ask her, by all means,” said Frank. “Or
I will ask your master, if you wish it. They
only can tell us, and it is a point we must find
out. Meantime, keep to your business as quietly
as you can. What makes you so sure that
Moore (is not that his name?) was never a
convict?”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1.63'>63</span>Ellen could give no better reason than that she
could wager her life upon it. She thought her
brother grown very pertinacious on a sudden,
because this was not perfectly satisfactory to
him; but Frank was not pertinacious—only
wary and affectionate.</p>

<hr class='c015'>
<h3 id='ch1.5' class='c013'><span class='sc'>Chapter V.</span><br> <br> THE CASTLES AT HOME.</h3>

<p class='c017'>It was very well for a man of Castle’s irritable
temper to be made a shepherd, instead of a
labourer at home, within sight and hearing of all
the bustle and difficulty occasioned by much
pressure of work and few hands to do it. He
could not have borne to be, as his wife said,
driven from pillar to post,—called off from one
thing before he had done it, to do something else
to which he was altogether unaccustomed. It
suited him much better to be out upon the downs
after the sheep; though even in that quiet place
he had his troubles. The sheep-walk was too
extensive to be under the management of one
person; and Castle’s brother-shepherd was not a
very congenial companion. He was a gentleman
convict;—a young man who had gamed away
his little fortune, and then taken to swindling,
for which he had been transported. Being unequal
to hard work, and having no mechanical
skill, he was sent out to tend sheep; an employment
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.64'>64</span>as little suitable as might be to his social
dispositions and active habits. The two reluctant
companions agreed only in their inclination
to grumble.</p>

<p class='c001'>“They call this a fine scene,” observed the
young man, “but it does not suit my taste. I
had rather see our sheep in the Smithfield pens
than on these downs. Then one misses the London
cries, however much the magpies chatter here.
As for the cooing of the doves, it really depresses
the spirits. People talk of the stars being so
brilliant here,—like golden lamps; but I like
real lamps better. A row of them in Pall Mall
is worth a hemisphere of stars.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I don’t know much about lamplight,” replied
Castle, “having been too poor to burn candles
at home, and so going to bed in the twilight;
but this place is so lonesome, I sometimes wonder
whether it is in the world or out of it. All this
view is like an old deserted park, to be sure; but
where is the squire’s house, or the church steeple,
and the children coming out of school? There
is no public-house far or near; and no parson
or his lady to speak a word to one: only a young
man that comes to read prayers on Sundays in a
shed or on the green, and away again to do the
same thing somewhere else. Not such a thing
have I seen since I came as a carriage with ladies
in it; and they say there are no hunts. With all
the game there is here, no scarlet jackets ever
come in sight from the woods.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“That is the worst of it,” responded the other
grumbler. “We have all the dulness of a country
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.65'>65</span>life without its solace of amusement. It was
really too tantalizing lately, to see a kangaroo
hunt which I could not join. If they would let
me take my turn, I might be of some use to them
as an experienced huntsman. I should like to hunt
opossums till I could get skins enough to make
your pretty daughter a cloak worthy to be worn;
and——”</p>

<p class='c001'>Castle here moved off impatiently, having too
much paternal pride to listen to convict wooing
on Ellen’s behalf. The young man followed him,
continuing,</p>

<p class='c001'>“The snipe-shooting is very choice, I’m told,
in the marshes yonder. I must have leave when
winter comes on, to go and try my luck. But
the hunts are the best things,—more spirited perhaps
than you are aware of.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Hunts! hunts!” cried Castle. “I see neither
deer nor fox. An odd sort of hunting, if
you mean killing any of these leaping things, with
their queer ways. Why, the little ones don’t
run beside their dams, as is natural, but she pops
them into her bag, and off she hops, as if she had
only two legs. The first I saw, I thought she
had happened an accident, and had her fore legs
cut short; and I thought she got on wonderfully
well considering; and then in a minute appeared
a whole herd of them, with their young in their
bags.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It is a pretty sight to see them come down
from the woods at sunrise to feed in the plains.
Then is the time to hide behind a thicket, and
make sure of one’s game. Which do you prefer,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.66'>66</span>as a bottom dish, kangaroo or bandicoot? In a
pie, properly seasoned, it is difficult to say which
is the best. I have given many a hint down
below that either is much more palatable to me
than rations of salt meat.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Castle, who thought no man need desire more
in the way of diet than to eat meat every day,
looked with contempt on the grimaces of his
companion over his ample supply of beef, wheaten
bread, and cider.</p>

<p class='c001'>“If you want to hunt,” said Castle, “I wish
you would kill off the vile beasts that have been
making havoc among my lambs. I might have
got at one, but I was downright scared with its
ugliness.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Was it the hyena or the devil?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“O, the devil, to judge by its looks. It is as
big as a middle-sized dog, with the head of
an otter, crowded with teeth. It moved very
slow, but I could do no better than stare at it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“They call it the devil here,” replied the gentleman.
“You should dig little pits, and set
your dogs upon it when it has fallen in. It will
go on worrying your lambs, unless you keep on
the watch.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Another thing that puts me out,” observed
Castle, “is that the beasts are one below another
here, as if they were bewitched. In England,
we have a horse of one size, and a dog of another,
and a rat of another; and none of them is like the
rest; but here we have a big kangaroo, and a
kangaroo the size of a dog, and another no
bigger than a rat; and these last are not real
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.67'>67</span>kangaroos. I declare it makes my hair stand up
to see a rat leaping like a real kangaroo: just as it
would to see a mouse shaking its mane and
trotting and cantering like a horse. I have not
been used to such freaks, and this is a country I
can’t understand.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I hope to understand it better,” replied the
convict. “I was always fond of roving, and in
time I may have explored farther than we can see
from these green hills that we both find so dull.
What do you mean to do when you get free?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“They may settle that that got me bound,”
replied Castle, testily. Then, struck with a sense
of his own ingratitude, he added, “To be sure, if
there is no squire’s house, there is no workhouse
either; and if I see no acquaintance, there is nobody
to taunt me with misfortune; but, on the
contrary, they make much of me at home. And
there’s——”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Your daughter.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“What; my little Susan! Yes, they make a
handy little thing of her already, and——”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I mean the other handy one, Ellen.”</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='corr67.24'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='‘She'>“She</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_67.24'><ins class='correction'>“She</ins></a></span> will do well enough, Sir, I assure you.
She has a fine spirit and a steady mind of her own,
and a proud brother to take care of her; and
that is better than a broken-down father; though
it should go hard with me but I would protect her,
Sir, if there was no one to do it better.”</p>

<p class='c001'>So saying, Castle walked off, showing by his
manner that he was not sociably disposed.</p>

<p class='c001'>His wife was much more altered within a short
time by her change of circumstances than he.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.68'>68</span>The first thing that seemed to affect her favourably
was the use that was made of her little daughter
in the household arrangements. When the
farmer’s wife found that her new domestic was
indolent and indifferent, she endeavoured to make
the best of a poor bargain by squeezing as much
work as she could out of Susan. The child was willing
enough, and proud to find herself of so much
use; but her mother was jealous on her account,
and began for the first time to show symptoms of
tenderness for her. She not only argued in her
defence, but helped her when she was more disposed
to proceed with her work than to “go and
play;” words which had little charm for a child
whose associations with play were those of hunger,
scolding, mockery, and all the miseries of pauper
life. When the farm servants rose at daybreak
to go forth for the day, Susan was always ready
to jump up at the first word, to replenish the
wallets and fill the cans, though her mother turned
round in bed, and muttered that it was too soon
to get up. She needed no reminding about tending
the house-lamb, and feeding the poultry, and
dusting as much of the coarse furniture as she
could reach. After breakfast, if any one would
lift her upon the dresser, or lay the utensils and
the bowl of water on the floor, she would wash up
without breaking anything: and she was always
at hand to carry messages into field or farm-yard,
or to help with dinner and supper, or to carry
letters to the spot where they were to be deposited
in readiness for the postman’s weekly call; and
when not able to do anything better, she could
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.69'>69</span>scare away the crows and cockatoos from the
fields and garden. Her mother thought this a
hard life for a little girl: but Susan was stout,
rosy, and merry; and the farmer himself found a
few minutes now and then to take her on his knee
and teach her the alphabet, in preparation for the
time when a schoolmaster could be brought within
reach. The first thing Mrs. Castle did heartily
was washing up, one day when Susan had nearly
scalded her fingers. She took more and more of
the child’s work from her, and still Susan turned
to something else; so that ere long, both were
pretty fully employed; and in proportion as the
once reckless and lazy pauper became interested
in the occupations going on around her,—in
proportion as she bestirred herself to get the
baking done while the house was clear of the
men, and the washing over in time to have a
chat in the evening,—she grew like the active
and tidy housewife she would never have become
in her own land.</p>

<p class='c001'>A circumstance which hastened this change
was the opportunity she now had of gratifying
one taste,—almost the only taste she ever had,
and which seemed to have died out under the
hardships of her condition: a taste for gardening.
When a girl, she had had a garden; and as long
as her husband had owned an acre of ground, she
took possession of a corner of it for her pinks and
roses, under pretence of growing vegetables for
the family. From that time to this, nobody had
heard her mention fruit or flowers; but Ellen
bore in mind her love for them now when the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.70'>70</span>remembrance might be turned to some purpose.
She mentioned, in her step-mother’s presence, that
her master was trying what he could do in the
management of vines, for the growth of which
the climate was peculiarly favourable; and that
whether he got any wine or not, his trouble would
be more than repaid by his profits from his other
fruits. The peaches, to be sure, were not of the
best sort, though so plentiful as to lie rotting on
the ground, after bushels had been thrown to the
pigs; but the apricots, and yet more the raspberries,
which grew to such a size and in such
quantity as no English person would believe without
seeing them, were likely to prove a good speculation,
being sent to a distance in the form of
jam. Sugar being remarkably cheap in this
country, there was little risk in trying a batch of
sweetmeats, which were to be sent to India for
sale by a vessel from Launceston. The idea was
caught up as Ellen expected it would be; and as
the farmer and his wife did not take to the
scheme of fruit-growing as heartily as was desired,
the emigrant family tried whether they
could not get a garden of their own. The small
part of their wages which they were yet at
liberty to use was applied to the purchase of a
plot of ground, and Frank found time to work in
it, and Ellen procured wherewith to stock it, and
their step-mother haunted it early and late, before
and after work,—and Castle himself relaxed his
brow, and spoke in a tone that was not querulous,
as he looked round upon that which, however
small, was so much more than he had ever
expected to possess again,—a family property.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1.71'>71</span>“Look at father,” whispered Ellen to her
brother. “I have not seen him and her arm-in-arm
since I was no bigger than Susan.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“He is like a prisoner that has been quite
shut up coming for the first time into the gaol
court,” said Frank. “The feel of the air makes
him push his hat up from over his eyes. Only
set him quite free, and he will uncover his brows,
and lift up his head like a man.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And so he ought,” replied Ellen, “since it is
for no fault of his own that he has been bound
down to poverty.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ah! poverty is a cold and dreary prison,
Ellen. That puts me in mind,—have you seen,
I wonder, any thing that has surprised you very
much lately,—any thing that you would like to
tell me if you were sure of not being overheard,
or of not being thought fanciful?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“The word ‘prison’ put me in mind of something
that I have been wanting to talk to you
about almost this month past.—I don’t know how
to believe my own eyes about it, but I am sure I
have seen Jerry in our farm-yard at night, and
lurking about among the sheds before most of
our folks are stirring in the morning.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Aye; but was he all alone, Ellen?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Bob was never with him, that I could see;
but he seemed to me to be waiting for somebody
off our premises, and I thought it must naturally
be me. So twice I ran out to catch him; but
once I was crossed by two of our people that I
don’t choose to come in the way of; and the
other time he was whispering with the same two,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.72'>72</span>so that I dared not go near. How could he get
liberty? and what could he be about?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Something very deep, I am afraid,” replied
her brother. “As to the liberty,—it is no difficult
matter for convicts who behave pretty regularly
to get hours of liberty at the beginning and
end of the day; and the lads being employed on
roadmaking so near, accounts for our getting a
glimpse of them sometimes. But what I am
uneasy about is Jerry’s having so much to say to
the convicts at your place and mine;—for I
have seen him at Stapleton’s oftener than you
have among your people. I am afraid of some
plot——”</p>

<p class='c001'>“O, mercy!” cried Ellen; “what sort of a
plot?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“That is more than I can say. Sometimes
they plot, I hear, for nothing worse than to
escape; but some have had to do with the natives,
(who are little better than wild beasts), and have
brought them down upon the farms, setting
them to steal and even to murder; for which they
pay the poor savage creatures by helping themselves
with their wives.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Ellen trembled while she asked whether any of
the natives could be in the neighbourhood.—Her
brother hoped not, as the government had declared
that they were driven back among the
mountains, where they must soon die out as their
wild cattle had done: but as long as any convicts
were disposed to bush-ranging,—and some did
actually escape every year,—he could not, for his
part, feel quite secure. He thought he should
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.73'>73</span>speak to Stapleton about it. Meanwhile, he
desired Ellen to drop not a syllable that should
alarm her father, or anybody else.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I hope, sister,” he continued with some
hesitation, “I hope Harry Moore has no acquaintance,
more or less, with Jerry, or any
other such people.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Ellen’s eyes flashed as they used to do when
she was a passionate little girl at school.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Harry!” she cried. “Harry Moore have
any sneaking doings! Harry Moore keep bad
company! You don’t know Harry a bit better
than the very first day,—the day when you
thought he might be a convict himself.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“No need to be angry, Ellen. He might
just know him enough, you see, to say ‘How d’ye
do?’ when they meet, and to judge how often
Jerry might fairly be here.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“After all,” said Ellen, sighing, “it is my
father’s own son that I flew off about his being
acquainted with; so there is no need for me to
be so proud. No; Harry does not know either
of the lads, even by sight; but I shall tell him
what you have been saying, though nobody else,
Frank.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Certainly. Conceal nothing that weighs
upon your mind from Harry, any more than if
he was your husband already. I look to him to
help me to keep an eye upon Bob, who may be
made something of, they say, little hope as there
is for Jerry. Bob works within bounds at spare
hours, instead of roving into the bush, or prowling
about the settlers’ farms, where he has no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.74'>74</span>business. Bob must be saving money fast,
unless he has unseen ways of spending it. He
works hard, and is well paid for his extra labour.
He may have the advantage of me, after all; and
settle on a place of his own before me.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Because he got a free passage as a punishment.
That is really very hard, Frank.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Harry Moore will be the first at liberty,
however, Ellen; and that I am glad of on your
account. I am soon to begin building you a
house, at over hours; and you may depend on
my doing my best to have it all complete by the
time the six months are gone.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Six months!” cried Ellen.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Why, I do not mean that you need wait till
then. You may fairly marry as soon as you
like;—and many in our own country would be glad
to have that said to them. I only mentioned six
months as the time when Harry would be all his
own master. Then I shall hope to see you
milking a cow of your own.—Meantime, till I
have found out more about Jerry, be cautious
how you get out of reach of those that will take
care of you.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Ellen sighed, and smiled, and wondered which
was the strangest world,—the one she had left
behind, or the new one which seemed, after
several months, nearly as foreign as when she
had entered it. She had no doubt which was
the pleasantest. How could she, when a vague
fear and thorough dislike of some of the people
in the neighbourhood were the only set-off against
the prosperity of all whom she loved, and her own
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.75'>75</span>bright prospects with such a husband as Harry
Moore had promised to be?</p>

<hr class='c015'>

<h3 id='ch1.6' class='c020'><span class='sc'>Chapter VI.</span><br> <br> LAW AND JUSTICE.</h3>

<p class='c017'>Though convicts were unhappily supplied at an
increasing rate from the mother-country, the demand
for free labourers throughout Van Diemen’s
Land became more urgent continually. The
young men who settled either as wool-growers,
farmers, or labourers, wanted wives. All above
the lowest rank needed servants. The sheep
were too many for the shepherds. There was too
little produce in proportion to the land; and too
few dwellings in proportion to the produce; too
much or too little of almost everything, for want
of a due proportion of labour. The same thing
is the case at home; only here the proportions
are exactly reversed. It will be very strange
if in a short time we do not rectify the condition
of each country by the exchange which would be
equally beneficial to both.</p>

<p class='c001'>Ireland and Van Diemen’s Land are islands
of about the same size. They are each favoured
by nature in an unusual degree, having all the
requisites of fertility, variety and beauty which
can fit them to be the abodes of a thriving and
happy population. The arable lands and pastures
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.76'>76</span>of both are excellent. The one has fisheries of
salmon, herring and cod; the other of whales, and
seals for export, and of a large variety of fish for
home consumption. Both have fine natural
harbours, ridges of protecting mountains, stores
of mineral treasure, inland lakes, and fresh
springs wherever man may incline to fix his
abode. Both have, with all these advantages,
their natural hardships and social troubles.</p>

<p class='c001'>The natural hardships of each might be almost
entirely removed by a well-conducted reciprocity
of assistance. Ireland has a population of eight
million; Van Diemen’s Land of only twenty-five
thousand. In Ireland, multitudes of half-starved
wretches pine in idleness, and many die by the
way-side, of that wasting of limb and heart and
life which is the form in which poverty perpetrates
murder. In Van Diemen’s Land, the labourer
is liable to be worn out by toil, and
fretted by seeing half his produce rotting on the
ground, or wastefully bestowed on swine; while
articles which he has always considered almost
as necessary as food cannot by any means be
procured. With him, abundance is not wealth,
and plenty brings not the happiness for which he
looked. If the wide sea did not lie between, he
would beckon to a dozen Irishmen to come and
nourish themselves with his superfluity, while he
gathers about him the comforts which spring out
of their industry, and solaces himself with a due
portion of that repose, without a certain share of
which the best ends of life cannot be attained.
Why should not a bridge be built across this wide
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.77'>77</span>sea with the capital which is now unproductively
expended on the maintenance of these paupers?
Why should not the charity which <em>cannot</em> in Ireland
give subsistence to one without taking it
from another, be employed in a way which gives
support to many, to the benefit of many more?
Whatever funds are judiciously employed on
emigration are used as if to bring to a junction
with the over-peopled country a rich region, into
which a hungry multitude may be poured, to the
relief of the old, and the great advantage of the
new land. If the wealthy among the inhabitants
of the old country would gladly if they could,
call up such a new region, drest in fertility, from
the surrounding sea, why do they delay effecting
what is to their purpose the same thing? Since
they cannot move the land to their poor, why do
they not agree to devote what they now give in
baneful charity to removing their poor to the
new land? Till such a general agreement is
arrived at, why do not individuals thus apply
their charity, knowing that thus they not only
relieve for a time, but establish for life;—that
they not only assist the immediate objects of their
bounty, but provide for their descendants of many
generations? The rich should choose for their
almoners the agents of emigration. Those who
have little to give should unite their resources to
send abroad a few of the young labourers of both
sexes who are eager to go. Those who have no
money to give, should bestow their services in
spreading the knowledge of the facts how poor-laws
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.78'>78</span>aggravate, and emigration alleviates, if it
does not remove, pauperism.</p>

<p class='c001'>If this had been done long ago, the places
whither we now transport our criminals might at
present have been as remarkable for the good
moral condition of their inhabitants as they actually
are for the reverse. If it were now to be
done effectually, it is yet possible that Botany Bay
may in time outgrow the odium attached to its
name, and become the chosen resort of the upright
and industrious. Indigence causes crime;
and by the prevention of indigence and its consequent
crime, we may become better able than
we now fancy ourselves to dispense with the institution
of penal settlements;—whose results are
as disgraceful to British wisdom as that of a legal
pauper provision.</p>

<p class='c001'>When Jerry and Bob were landed at Launceston,
they were as unable as those who sent them
were disinclined, to reflect on the difference between
their being sent there, innocent, to provide
an honest livelihood for themselves, and being
deposited as a curse upon this new region,—both
guilty and one hardened, proscribed by the old
country and dreaded by the new, and prepared
to baffle all the professed objects of their punishment.
The guilt of these lads was distinctly referrible
to indigence. Their parents could give
them little wherewith to provide for their bodies,
and nothing of that care and instruction which
were peculiarly needful to them in their circumstances
of temptation. Being thus made outcasts,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.79'>79</span>they acted as outcasts; from which time it became
a struggle between themselves and society
which could inflict the most misery upon the
other. They put society in fear, violated its rights,
mocked its institutions, and helped to corrupt its
yet innocent members. Society inflicted on them
disgrace, bondage, and banishment; and from
all this misery no good resulted, however much
was proposed.</p>

<p class='c001'>The judge who pronounced sentence on Jerry
and Bob told them that it was necessary to the
security of society that they should be prevented
from inflicting any further injury by their evil
deeds.—There are two ways by which such prevention
may be accomplished; one by the death,
the other by the reformation, of the offender.
Death was too severe a punishment for the
offence of these lads; the judge must therefore
have contemplated their reformation, or have
thought only of England when he spoke of society.
Did the law gain its object?</p>

<p class='c001'>“I say, Bob,” said Jerry one evening, when
they had got the leave it is so easy to obtain to
go out of bounds, and work for themselves over-hours,—“I
say, do you remember what that fellow
in Newgate read us about that cursed gaol where
the people are mewed up as close as if they were
in a school, and closer?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“What that where they are shut in by themselves
all night, and hard worked all day, and nobody
may speak but the parson, and he praying
and preaching night and morning, till a fellow’s
spirit is downright broken? Remember it! aye;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.80'>80</span>and glad enough I have been many a time that
we are not there. I’d rather be hanged twice
over.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Hanged! Yes: there’s not much in hanging.
I have seen it several times, and thought to
myself, ‘if that’s all, I should not mind it.’ But
we are the best off, after all. I was horribly
afraid, when old wiggy began to whimper, that
it was to be the hulks, or a long prison, instead
of going abroad; for one never knows what
they mean when they say ‘transportation.’ You
would not have looked so downcast as you did if
you had known what was before you.“</p>

<p class='c001'>“Not I. I never thought to be made of so
much consequence. ’Tis good fun to see them
quarrel which shall have us, and to get them to
bid rum and brandy against each other to seduce
us away. We that could not get dry bread at
home,—how easy it is for us to fill our stomachs
with the choice of the land, and get drunk with
our masters at the end of the day,—our masters
being luckily of our own sort!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yours, that is, Bob; not mine. But I
don’t know but I like mine as well. He gives
me plenty of spare hours, on condition of my
bringing back what I earn. You should have
seen what a fright he looked in when somebody
said the folks were growing moral at home, and
no more convicts were to be sent out.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“He was as sorry as some honester folks
would be glad, Jerry. But as for dividing your
earnings with your master,—they are a queer
sort of earnings, I have a notion.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1.81'>81</span>“Easily got enough. ’Tis only just prowling
on the downs in a dark night to meet a stray
sheep; or making a venture into the fold. Then,
if one gets so far as into the bush, there are
other ways that you know nothing of yet, Bob.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I never can make out how you get seal oil
from the woods; being as we are thirty miles
from the sea.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Jerry laughed, and offered to introduce his
brother one day to somebody in the bush he little
dreamed of.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Do you mean, Frank, poor fellow, or Ellen?
They would not go so far to meet you.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Do you think I would ask them? It will
be time enough for me to notice Frank when I
have a house of my own to ask him into. I
shall be the master of such as he before his time
is out.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You need not carry yourself so high, Jerry.
You are in a worse bondage than he just now.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Curse them that put me into it, and let them
see if I bear it long! However, hold your
tongue about it now. There is the moon through
the trees, and the free turf under our feet. What
a pity there is nobody with a heavy purse likely
to pass while we are resting in the shadow under
this clump! ’Tis such dull work when there is
nothing better to be had than sheep and poultry,
and so many of them that they are scarcely
worth the taking!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I like roving for the sake of roving,” said
Bob. “I have plenty of mutton without stealing
it.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1.82'>82</span>“I like robbing for the sake of robbing,”
replied his brother; “and the mutton is only the
price of my frolic. But there is something I
like better. Let us be off, and I will show you,
(if you’ll swear not to blab,) how you may get
such sport as you little think for. Learn to
handle a gun, and to cross a farm-yard like a
cat, and to tap at a back-door like a mouse
within a wainscot, and you may laugh at the
judge and the law, and all the dogs they have
set to worry us.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Why no, thank’ee,” replied Bob. “I am
trying after a character, you know, so I shall
stay where I am. I’ll light my pipe; and I’ve
got rum enough to last till morning both for myself
and somebody I rather expect to meet me.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Take care she be not too deep for you, Bob.
If ever you want a wife with no more sense than
a monkey, and not half as many tricks, ask me,
and I will show you how to get one.”</p>

<p class='c001'>So much for the reformation of the offender.
The other kind of security on which the judge
expatiated was that afforded by the criminal being
made a warning.</p>

<p class='c001'>A waggon load of new convict-labourers arrived
at the Dairy Plains one day, when the
accustomed gang was at work on the road which
was not yet completed. The masters who happened
to be present were too much taken up with
observing the new-comers to pay any attention to
the looks of their labourers. They did not see
the winks, and the side-long smiles, they did not
hear the snapping of fingers behind their backs;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.83'>83</span>they had no suspicion that some in the waggon
were old acquaintances of those on the road.
On the first opportunity after the fresh men were
left with the others, and only one or two over-lookers
near, there was a prodigious hand-shaking
and congratulation, and questioning. “How did
you get over?” “How did you manage to get
sent <em>here</em>?” “How do you like transportation?”
“You’ll soon learn to know your own luck.”
“This is a fine country, is it not?” &#38;c. &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I was so cursedly dull after you all went
away,” observed one of the new-comers, “there
was nothing to stay for: but I very near got sent
to Sidney.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well; you could soon have got away, either
home or here. But how do you find yourself
off?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“With a bed to myself and a blanket, and
rare good living to what I had when I was an
honest man. The thing I don’t like is the work;
but they say we are to have plenty of spirits.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“To be sure; and as to the work,—what do the
poor wretches at home do but work as hard as you,
and for less than you can get in spare hours.
But where’s Sam? Why did not he come too?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“He got baulked, as he deserved for being a
fool. What did he do but send his sister to the
justice to know how much he must steal to be
transported, and no more? The justice set the
parson at him; and between the two, they have
cowed him, poor fellow, and he will never better
his condition.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Perhaps he is afraid. Perhaps he believes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.84'>84</span>what the judge said about our being a warning.
And yet he tipped me the wink when that was
said, and when some of the pretty ones in the
gallery began to cry.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“He knows better than you think. If you
were as moped as a linnet in a cage, he would
know nothing of it; because you are too far off
for him to see what became of you, in that case;
but, being as you are, a merry, rollicking set,
he would like to be among you; and that sort of
news travels fast.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Another of the party did not like his lot so
well. He said nothing of the disgrace, though
he felt it; but he complained of the toil, of the
tyranny of the masters, of the spite and bickerings
of his companions.</p>

<p class='c001'>“If you don’t like your company, change it,”
replied one to whom he had opened his mind.
“Such a good hand as you are at a burglary, I
don’t wonder that you had rather steal enough in
one night to live upon for a month, than work as
commoner hands do. You had better go back.
Jerry will tell you how. Nothing is easier.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well; but there is my little woman yonder,
that they were so kind as to send over at the
same time; how is she to get back? She can’t
turn sailor, and get her passage home in that
way.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Trust her for making terms with some gull
of a sailor,” replied the other, laughing. “It is
only following an old trade for a particular reason;
and you’ll give her leave till you touch land again.
But let me hear before you go; there are some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.85'>85</span>acquaintance of mine in London that will be glad
to know you; and you may chance to help one
another; though, to be sure, you take a higher
line.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Are you thinking of sending over the fee
they raised for your defence?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I did intend it, as a point of honour; but
they assure me they made a good bargain of it as
it was. They could have paid the fee three times
over out of the plate-chest they stole for it. So
I don’t know that I need trouble myself.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“So while Counsellor H—— was preaching
about your being tried that people might be safe,
there was another robbery going on to pay him
his fees. That’s rare! You should go back,
(since the way is so easy,) and pick Counsellor
H—’s pocket. That will mend the joke.”</p>

<p class='c001'>So much for the security to society from the
exhibition of this kind of warning.</p>

<hr class='c015'>

<h3 id='ch1.7' class='c020'><span class='sc'>Chapter VII.</span><br> <br> CHRISTMAS AMUSEMENTS.</h3>

<p class='c017'>Ellen’s wedding day drew near. Frank and
Harry Moore had toiled together at spare hours
to erect and fit up a convenient dwelling; and
there was no fear whatever but that she and her
husband would be amply supplied with all the
necessaries and many of the comforts of life.
Her father began to smile upon her, though he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.86'>86</span>muttered complaints of there being so many
changes always going on that none of them ever
knew when they were settled. Her step-mother,
though still hinting that the girl knew what she
was about when she was in such a hurry to come
away from a poor parish, seemed very well satisfied
to have matters so arranged, and rather proud
than otherwise of belonging to Ellen. The farmer
and his wife whom Ellen served sighed when
they found she was going to leave them, and observed
that it was always the way, as soon as they
got suited with a dairy maid; but as she agreed
to go on taking care of their cows till they could
obtain another damsel in her place from Hobart
Town, they treated her very graciously. The
only serious drawback to her comfort was that
Harry’s fellow-labourers would go on courting
her, though they knew she was engaged, and that
this caused Harry to be more jealous than she
felt there was any occasion for, or than she could
easily excuse. She had no other fault to find with
Harry; but she was more than once on the point
of breaking off the match on this account, and if
it had not been for Frank’s interposition, and his
assurances that such feelings were very natural in
Harry, she would have thrown away her own
happiness for want of being sufficiently aware of
the danger of such a position as hers to a girl of
less principle than herself.—A circumstance happened,
a few days before her marriage, which
everybody else thought very disastrous; but which
she could not think so, since it established a perfect
understanding between Harry and herself.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1.87'>87</span>On the morning of the 21st of December,—the
height of summer in Van Diemen’s Land,—Frank
appeared, breathless, in the farm-yard
whither Ellen was just going to milk her cows;
Castle at the same moment was seen at some
distance, hastening from the downs where he
ought to have been tending his sheep at this hour;
Harry Moore next leaped the gate and wiped his
brows, seeming too much agitated to speak; the
farmer pulled his hat over his eyes, in anticipation
of the news that was coming, and the
women crowded together in terror.—Ellen was
the first to ask what was the matter.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Have your men decamped, farmer?” inquired
Frank.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes, almost to a man. Have Stapleton’s?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Two out of four; and every settler in the
neighbourhood misses more or less this morning.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Now the devil and his imps will be on us in
the shape of a gang of <a id='corr87.21'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='bush rangers'>bush-rangers</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_87.21'><ins class='correction'>bush-rangers</ins></a></span>,” muttered
the farmer.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Not on us, farmer. They will more likely
go to some distant part where their faces are
strange.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“If they do, they will send strange faces here,
which comes to the same thing; for one bush-ranger’s
face is as devilish as another. One of
us must be off in search of a guard, and our
shepherds, and indeed all of us, must carry
arms.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Ellen turned pale at the mention of arms.
Harry drew to her side, and told her in a tone of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.88'>88</span>forced calmness that three of her lovers were
gone.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Gone!” cried Ellen joyfully. “Gone for
good?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Gone for ever as lovers of yours.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Thank God!” said she. “Better watch
night and day with arms in our hands than have
your head full of fancies, Harry. You will never
believe again that I can like such people: and
you shall teach me to fire a gun, so as to defend
the house while you are away; and I shall not
be afraid of anything when you are at home.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Harry was so alert and happy from this
moment that one would have thought there had
been a certainty that no bush-rangers would ever
come again, instead of a threatening that those
who had till now been servants would soon reappear
as enemies.</p>

<p class='c001'>Whatever arms could be found up were put
into the hands of the shepherds, as they were
most in danger from violence for the sake of their
flocks. They were desired to keep in sight of
one another so far as that each should be able to
make a certain signal agreed on, in case of his
having reason to suppose that there were enemies
at hand. Frank departed immediately for Launceston,
for powder and ball, and a further supply
of labourers to fill the places of those who had
eloped. Another messenger was sent to the seat
of government to give information of what had
happened. During the absence of her brother,
Ellen heard enough of the evils inflicted by runaway
convicts to alarm a stouter heart than any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.89'>89</span>young girl devotedly attached to her lover ever
had; and to add to her uneasiness, her father
once more became gloomy, and poor little Susan
clung to her side wherever she went. Harry
left his work twenty times a day to tell her that
all was quiet, and bid her not be alarmed.
During the day, she followed his advice pretty
well; but in the evenings, so many tales of horror
went round that, though she did not believe the
half of them, her confidence was shaken; and
she went to bed shuddering to think of what
might have happened before morning.</p>

<p class='c001'>The bush-rangers seemed to be less dreaded
by the settlers than the natives. The bush-rangers
came down in a troop, carried off what
they wanted, occasionally shooting a man or two
during the process, and then went completely
away. The warfare of the natives was much
more horrible,—their movements being stealthy,
their revenge insatiable, their cruelty revolting.
They would hover about for days or weeks before
committing an outrage, planning the most
wicked way of proceeding, and seizing the most
defenceless moment for pouncing on their
victims. Castle asked aloud, what Ellen inquired
in her heart, why all this was not told them
before they came, and what there was in wealth
which could compensate for such alarms as they
were now suffering under? Frank satisfied her,
in some degree, when he returned on the 24th,—the
day before her wedding. He told her
that though the first settlers had suffered dreadfully
from the murders and plunder of the hostile
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.90'>90</span>natives and runaway convicts, this was not a sufficient
reason to deter other settlers from following,
since, owing to the vigorous measures of the
Australian government, such outrages had been
repressed and nearly put an end to. He pointed
out to her that the horrible tales she had been
told related to former times, and assured her that,
except in some districts near the wilder parts of
the island, the face of a savage had not been
seen for years.—Ellen pointed to the mountain
wastes on which their settlement bordered,
and Frank acknowledged that the Dairy
Plains lay as open to an attack as most newly-settled
districts; but he had been assured at
Launceston that there was no need to terrify
themselves with apprehensions as long as they
were armed and properly careful in their movements;
since the sound of a musket would disperse
a whole troop of savages, and they attacked
no place that was not left absolutely
defenceless. He had distinctly ascertained what
he had before conjectured,—that it was not the
practice of runaway convicts to plunder settlements
where their faces were known, and that
the only danger therefore arose from the probability
that they might injure the savages, who
might come down to wreak their revenge upon
the innocent settlers.</p>

<p class='c001'>“If this is all,” sighed Ellen, “there is
nothing——”</p>

<p class='c001'>“To prevent your being married to-morrow,
Ellen. So I have been telling Harry.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“There was no occasion, thank you. I never
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.91'>91</span>meant to put it off. The more danger, the more
reason for our being together. Besides, it will
help to take father’s mind off from his discontent.
He has been wishing himself back in Kent every
hour since you went.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Indeed! Well now, I think that such an
occasional fright as this is little to the hardship
of living as we did at A——, to say nothing of
the certainty of there soon being an end to it.
The only two evils our settlers suffer from will
grow less every year; the scarcity of labour, and
danger of theft. To make up for these, we have
the finest climate in the world, abundance of all
that we at present want, and the prospect of
seeing our children, and their children again,
well provided for.—But you must be in a hurry
now, dear, considering what has to be done
to-morrow. So go, and cheer up, and trouble
your head no more about black or white thieves.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Ellen had, however, little more than usual to
do this day, as hers was not the kind of wedding
to require preparation. The travelling chaplain
who was to come and perform the Christmas
service, was to marry the young people, and
thus only was the day to be marked as different
from any other. The settlers, no doubt, thought
much of their friends in England, and of the
festivities which are there enjoyed by all but
those whose poverty deprives them of the means:
but the seasons are so entirely reversed in Van
Diemen’s Land,—it is so impossible amidst the
brilliant verdure, the heat and long days of the
Christmas season there, to adopt the festivities
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.92'>92</span>carried on at home beside the hearth and over
the punch-bowl, that Christmas-day was allowed
to pass quietly, and the grand holidays of the
year were wisely made on the anniversaries of
their settlement in their present abodes,—of their
entrance on a life of prosperity.</p>

<p class='c001'>No fairer morning ever dawned than that on
which Ellen arose very early, and stole out to find
that refreshment in the open air which she was
not disposed to seek in more sleep. She had
rested well for a few hours, but the first rays of
the sun finding their way into her chamber,
(which was more like a clean loft than an English
bedroom), roused her to thoughts that prevented
her sleeping again. It was too soon to
be looking after her cows; so she took her
knitting, and sat on the bench outside the house,
whence she could look over a vast tract of
country, and where she was pretty sure of an
hour’s quiet. She had some thoughts to spare
for her old Kentish neighbours; and began to
fancy how her grandmother would be getting up
three hours after, when it would be scarcely
dawning, to make the room tidy, and light the
fire to boil the kettle; and how the old couple
would put on their best, and draw over the hearth
with their Christmas breakfast. Then she thought
of the many boys and girls she knew who would
be going to church, with red noses, and shivering
in their scanty clothing. Then she sighed when
she remembered that she might never more hear
psalms sung in a church; and again she smiled
while fancying Mr. Fellowes’s great dinner to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.93'>93</span>half the parish,—a dinner of roast beef and ale
and plum puddings, and Mr. Jackson there to
say grace, and the clerk to sing a Christmas
carol, and every old man giving a toast by turns,
and some one perhaps to propose the healths of
their friends far away. She blushed, all alone as
she was, when she wondered what they would say
if they knew she was to be married so soon,
especially if they could see Harry. It was strange,
while her mind was thus full of pictures of a frosty
day, of a smoking table, of a roaring fire, lamps,
and a steaming punch-bowl, to look up and
observe what was before her eyes. The scene
was not even like a midsummer morning in
Kent. It was not dotted with villages: there
were no hop-grounds, and all the apples grown
within five miles would hardly have made an
orchard. There were no spires among the trees;
nor did the morning mists rise from the dells or
hover over the meadows. All was clear and dry
and verdant under the deep blue sky. No haze
hung over the running streams that found their
way among the grassy hillocks. Neither oak
nor beech grew on the hill side, nor pines on the
ridges of the mountains behind; but trees to
whose strange foliage her eye was yet unaccustomed
reared their lofty stems where it did not
appear that the hand of man was likely to have
planted them; and myrtles and geraniums grew
up roof-high, like the finest monthly roses in
England. Instead of the little white butterflies
flitting over the daisied turf, there were splendid
ones alighting here and there in the neighbouring
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.94'>94</span>garden, larger and gayer than the finest of the
flowers they fed upon. Instead of the lark rising
from her dewy nest into the pink morning cloud,
there were green and crimson parrots glancing
among the lofty evergreens. Instead of flickering
swarms of midges, flies shone like emeralds in
the sun. Instead of a field-mouse venturing out
of its hole, or frogs leaping across the path,
speckled and gilded snakes (of which Ellen had
learned not to be afraid) wriggled out into the
sunshine, and finding that the world was not all
asleep, made haste to hide themselves again.</p>

<p class='c001'>“If I could fancy any part of this to be England,”
thought Ellen, “it would be yonder spot
behind the range of woodland, where the smoke
is rising. If that were but grandfather’s cottage,
how I would run and bring them here before any
body else was up. They will be so sorry not to
have seen me married, and not to know Harry!
But I cannot make out that smoke. I did not
know that anybody lived there, and it looks more
than enough to come from a single chimney.
Perhaps the man that found the brick clay, and
talked of having a kiln, may have settled there.
I will ask Harry. I wonder what o’clock it is
now! He said he should finish his morning’s
work first, that he might stay when he did come.
How odd it seems that there are so few people
to do things here, that a man can scarcely be
spared from his work on his wedding day! They
must be all over-sleeping themselves, I think. I’ll
just get the milk-pails, and that may wake them;
and if the cows are milked a little earlier than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.95'>95</span>usual, it will not signify. I only get fidgetty,
sitting here, and fancying noises; from missing
the singing-birds, I dare say, that are busy
among the boughs on such a morning as this in
England. It was an odd squeak and whistle that
I heard just now; perhaps a quail or a parroquet,
or some other bird that I don’t know the note of
yet. Or it might be one of those noisy black
swans on the lake yonder. I will not stay any
longer to be startled. That was only a butterfly
that flew dazzling before my eyes; and these
flies do not sting, so I need not mind their buzzing.
There! I had rather hear that lowing that I have
been used to from a child than any music in the
world. I should be sorry indeed to give up
these cows, for all I am going to have one of
my own.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Ellen purposely made some noise in getting
her pails, that she might wake somebody and
find out how time went. She could not account
for the sun being so low in the sky till she heard
the farmer growl that he wished people would be
quiet till it was time to get up; which it would
not be for two hours yet.</p>

<p class='c001'>After pausing before the door to watch the distant
smoke, which had much increased, Ellen repaired
to the cow-yard, immediately behind the
dwelling. She stumbled on something in the
litter which she mistook for a little black pig, till
its cry made her think it was something much
less agreeable to meet with. Stooping down, she
saw that it was certainly a black baby; ugly and
lean and dirty; but certainly a baby. She did
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.96'>96</span>not scream; she had the presence of mind not to
touch the little thing, remembering that, for
aught she knew, the parents might be lurking
among the sheds, and ready to spring upon her
if she should attempt to carry away the infant,
which had probably been dropped in the hurry
of getting out of her way. Trembling and
dreading to look behind her, she stepped back
into the house, and now roused the farmer in
good earnest. In a few minutes, the whole
household was in the cow-yard; the men not
choosing to separate, and the women being afraid
to leave their protectors. The child was still
there, and nothing was discovered in the general
search of the premises which now took place.
When the farmer saw the smoke at a distance,
he ascribed it at once to a party of natives having
set the grass on fire in cooking their kangaroo
repast. He thought it probable that two or three
spies might be at hand, and the rest of the party
ready for a summons to fall on the farm as soon
as it should, by any accident, be left undefended.
He would not have the child brought into the
house, but fed it himself with milk, and laid it on
some straw near where it was found, in a conspicuous
situation. Beside it he placed some
brandy, and a portion of food for the parents, if
they should choose to come for it.</p>

<p class='c001'>“There is no knowing,” said he, “but they
may be looking on; and one may as well give
them the chance of feeling kindly, and making
peace with us.” And he silenced one of his
men who began to expatiate on the impossibility
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.97'>97</span>of obtaining any but a false peace with these
treacherous savages.</p>

<p class='c001'>Nothing could satisfy Harry but standing over
his betrothed with a musket while she was milking.
As for her, every rustle among the leaves,
every movement of the cow before her, made her
inwardly start; though she managed admirably
to keep her terrors to herself.</p>

<p class='c001'>The arrival of the chaplain happened fortunately
for collecting the neighbouring settlers;
and, by the farmer’s desire, nothing was said of
what had happened till the services he came to
perform were ended. Harry and Ellen were
married, amidst some grave looks from the
family of which they had till now made a part,
and the smiles of all the guests. Ellen’s disappointed
lovers,—the only people who could possibly
disapprove of the ceremony,—were absent;
and she tried not to think about what they might
be doing or planning.</p>

<p class='c001'>The barking of the dogs next drew the party
to the door, and they saw what was a strange
sight to many of the new-comers. A flock of
emus, or native ostriches, was speeding over the
plain, almost within shot.</p>

<p class='c001'>“What are they?” inquired one.</p>

<p class='c001'>“’Tis many a month since we have seen an
emu,” observed another. “I thought we had
frightened away all that were left in these
parts.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“What are you all about,” cried a third.
“Out with the dogs and after them! Make
chase before it is too late!”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1.98'>98</span>“A decoy! a decoy!” exclaimed the farmer.
“Now I am certain that mine is a marked place.
These savages have driven down the emus before
them, to tempt us men out to hunt, and they are
crouching near to fall on while we are away.”</p>

<p class='c001'>He was as bold, however, as he was discerning.
He left three or four men to guard
the women and stock at home, and set off, as if
on a sudden impulse, to hunt emus with the rest
of his company, determining to describe a circuit
of some miles, (including the spot whence the
smoke arose) and to leave no lurking place
unsearched. Frank went with him. Castle
insisted on following his usual occupation on the
downs, declaring himself safe enough, with companions
within call, and on an open place where
no one could come within half a mile without
being seen. This was protection enough against
an enemy who carried no other weapons than
hatchets and pointed sticks, hardly worthy of the
name of spears.—Harry remained, of course, with
his bride.</p>

<p class='c001'>The day wore away tediously while the home guard
now patrolled the premises, now indolently
began to work at any little thing that might happen
to want doing in the farm-yard, and then came
to sit on the bench before the door, complaining
of the heat. The women, meanwhile, peeped
from the door, or came out to chat, or listened
for the cry of the dogs, that they might learn in
which direction the hunting party was turning.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ellen,” said her husband, “I do wonder
you can look so busy on our wedding day.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1.99'>99</span>“O, I am not really busy! It is only to drive
away thought when you are out of sight.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well then, come with me across the road,—just
to our own cottage, and see how pretty it
was made for us to have dined in to-day, if all this
had not happened. Frank was there after you
left it last night; and there is more in it than
you expect to see.—Now, don’t look so afraid.
It is no further than yonder saw-pit; and I tell
you there is not a hole that a snake can creep
into that we have not searched within this hour.—I
do not believe there is a savage within
twenty miles.—O, the baby!—Aye. I suppose
it dropped from the clouds, or one of the dogs
may have picked it up in the bush. ’Tis not for
myself that I care for all this disturbance: ’tis
because they have spoiled your wedding day so
that you will never bear to look back to it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Ellen wished they were but rid of their black
foes for this time, and then she should care little
what her wedding day had been. They said that
one sight of a savage in a life-time was as much
as most settlers had.—She must step in passing
to see what ailed the poor infant, which was
squalling in much the same style as if it had had
a white skin;—a squall against which Ellen could
not shut her heart any more than her ears.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I must take it and quiet it,” said she. “I
can put it down again as we come back in ten
minutes.”</p>

<p class='c001'>So lulling and rocking the little woolly-headed
savage in her arms, she proceeded to her own
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.100'>100</span>cottage, to admire whatever had been suggested
by her husband, and added by her neat-handed
brother.</p>

<p class='c001'>“What bird makes that odd noise?” inquired
Ellen presently. “A magpie, or a parrot, or
what? I heard it early this morning, and never
before. A squeak and then a sort of whistle.
Hark!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“’Tis no bird,” said Harry in a hoarse whisper.
“Shut and bar the door after me!”</p>

<p class='c001'>And he darted out of the cottage. Instead of
shutting the door, Ellen flew to the window to
watch what became of Harry. He was shouting
and in full pursuit of something which leaped
like a kangaroo through the high grass. He
fired, and, as she judged by his cry of triumph,
reached his mark. A rustle outside the door at
this moment caught her excited ear; and on turning,
she saw, distinct in the sunshine on the
door-sill, the shadow of a human figure, as of
some one lying in wait outside. Faint with the
pang of terror, she sunk down on a chair in the
middle of the room, with the baby still in her
arms, and gazed at the open doorway with eyes
that might seem starting from their sockets.
Immediately the black form she dreaded to see
began to appear. A crouching, grovelling savage,
lean and coarse as an ape, showing his teeth
among his painted beard, and fixing his snakelike
eyes upon hers, came creeping on his knees
and one hand, the other holding a glittering
hatchet. Ellen made neither movement nor
sound. If it had been a wild beast, she might
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.101'>101</span>have snatched up a loaded musket which was
behind her, and have attempted to defend herself;
but this was a man,—among all his deformities,
still a man; and she was kept motionless by
a more enervating horror than she would once
have believed any human being could inspire her
with. It was well she left the weapon alone.
It was better handled by another. Harry, returning
with the musket he had just discharged,
caught a full view of the creature grovelling at
his door, and had the misery of feeling himself
utterly unable to defend his wife. In a moment,
he bethought himself of the back window, and of
the loaded musket standing beside it. It proved
to be within reach; but his wife was sitting
almost in a straight line between him and the
savage. No matter! he must fire, for her last
moment was come if he did not. In a fit of
desperation he took aim as the creature was preparing
for a spring. The ball whistled past
Ellen’s ear, and lodged in the head of the foe.</p>

<p class='c001'>They were indeed safe, though it was long
before they could believe themselves so, or Ellen
could take courage to cross to the farm to tell
what had happened. As there were no more
traces of lurkers in the neighbourhood, it was
supposed that the one shot in the grass was the
mother, the one in the door-way, the father of the
infant which no one now knew what to do with.
It might be dangerous to keep it, whether it flourished
or died under the care of the settlers; and
there seemed to be no place where it could be
deposited with the hope of its being found by its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.102'>102</span>own tribe. When Frank and his companions
returned from the hunt, they threw light on this
and other curious matters, and brought comfortable
tidings to the inmates of the farm. The
Castles, indeed, and they alone, found as much
matter of concern as of comfort in what Frank
had to tell.</p>

<p class='c001'>In following the emu hunt, the farmer and his
party had skirted a tract of woodland, called the
bush, within which they perceived traces of persons
having lately passed. On searching further,
they came upon a scene rather different from
what they had expected, and not the most agreeable
in the world, though it fully accounted for
the visit of the natives.—Under a large mimosa,
which waved its long branches of yellow flowers
over the turf, and made a flickering shade, lay
Jerry, enjoying the perfection of convict luxury;
that is, smoking his pipe, drinking rum, and
doing what he pleased, with a black wife, who,
having skinned the kangaroo and lighted the fire,
squatted down on the turf, waiting for further
orders. If it had not been for the child she
carried in a hood of hide on her shoulders, she
would have been taken for a tame monkey, so
little was there human in her appearance and
gestures; but the tiny face that peeped over her
shoulder had that in it which bespoke humanity,
however soon the dawning rationality might be
destined to be extinguished.—On seeing the hunting-party,
Jerry sprang to his feet, seized his
arms, and whistled shrill and long; whereupon
so many hootings and whistlings were heard
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.103'>103</span>through the wood, so many ferocious faces appeared
from among the brakes on every hand
that it became prudent to explain that no war
was intended by the hunting-party. Frank and
Jerry were the spokesmen; and the result of
their conference was the communication of news
of much importance to both parties. Jerry
learned that the settlements below were so well
guarded and reinforced that any attempt at plunder
must fail; and he assured Frank that he was
about to depart at once with his band to one of
the islands in Bass’s Strait, to live among, or
reign over the natives, as many a convict had
done before him. He owned that his black wife
was stolen, and that her husband having been
knocked on the head in the scuffle, the rest of
the savage party had gone down to wreak their
revenge on the first whites they could meet with.
He was really sorry, he declared, to hear how
Ellen’s wedding-day had been disturbed; and
solemnly promised to draw off the foe to a distant
quarter, and watch that they did not again
molest the Dairy Plains. Frank could trust to
these promises, as poor Jerry, amidst all his iniquities,
retained a rude sense of honour, and a
lingering attachment to his family,—especially a
pride in his sister Ellen.—Frank learned with
great satisfaction that Bob’s disappearance from
the neighbourhood was not owing to his having
run away. He had refused to do so, his ambition
being to become a great man in the settlement,
provided he could accomplish his object
without too much trouble and self-denial. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.104'>104</span>had made a merit of remaining at his work when
his comrades eloped, and had, in consequence,
got promoted to a better kind of employment, by
which he had it in his power to make a good deal
of money.</p>

<p class='c001'>“And now, Ellen,” said Frank, on concluding
the story of his morning’s adventures, “I must
go and bring you the wedding present poor Jerry
left behind for you.” And he explained that a
sun-dial was hidden in a secure place, whence it
should be brought and put up immediately.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Is it stolen, do you think?” inquired Ellen
timidly. “Indeed, I had rather not have it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It is not stolen. A watch-maker, a clever
man enough, came over in the same ship with
the lads, and Jerry paid him for making this dial
for you, knowing you had no watch. He could
easily have sent you money, he said, but thought
you would like this better, since there is little
that can be bought in these parts that you have
not without money.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I don’t know how it is,” observed Ellen; “but
though it is very shocking that Jerry has got
among these people, and into such a brutal way
of life, I feel less afraid of them now that he is
there. If it were not for this, I should feel that
such a fright as we have had will set against a
great deal of the good we have fallen in with
here.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It always happens, Ellen, all through life,
and all over the world, that there is something to
set against other things; and never more so than
when people leave their own country. If a man
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.105'>105</span>quits England through intolerable poverty, he
must not expect to find everything to his mind,
and abundance besides. If he goes to Canada,
he may gain what he emigrates for,—food for
himself and property to leave to his children; but
he must put up with tremendous toil and hardship
till he can bring his land into order, and
with long, dreary winters, such as he had no notion
of before. If he goes to the Cape, he finds
a better climate and less toil; but from the manner
of letting land there, he is out of the way of
society and neighbourhood, and cannot save so
as to make his children richer than himself. If
he comes here, he finds the finest climate in the
world, and an easy way of settling; but then
there is the plague of having convicts always
about him, and the occasional peril of being
robbed;—and in some few of the wilder parts of
the island, of an individual here and there being
murdered. But this last danger is growing less
every year, and cannot exist long.—Now, since
there is evil everywhere, the question is what is
the least? I, for one, think them all less than
living in England in hopeless poverty, or even
than getting a toilsome subsistence there with
the sight of hopeless poverty ever before one’s
eyes, and the groans or vicious mirth of pauperism
echoing through the alleys of all the cities of
England. I, for one, feel it well worth anything
troublesome we have met with, or can meet with
here, to plant my foot on this hill, and look down
upon yonder farmsteads, and over all these plains
and hills and dales, with smoke rising here and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.106'>106</span>there, and say to myself ‘There is not so much
as one pauper within a hundred miles.’”</p>

<p class='c001'>When, after a few days, the black baby had,
by Jerry’s means, been restored to his tribe,
when the country was known to be clear of such
unwelcome intruders, and Harry and Ellen were
therefore at liberty to settle down at length in
their own house, the bride was quite of her brother’s
opinion respecting the goodliness of the
exchange from pauperism in Kent to plenty in
Van Diemen’s Land.</p>

<h3 id='ch1.8' class='c020'><span class='sc'>Chapter VIII.</span><br> <br> THE MORE THE BETTER CHEER.</h3>

<p class='c017'>Frank kept his promise of writing to his friend
Mr. Jackson, from time to time, as he had opportunity.
One of his letters, written four years
after his arrival in the Dairy Plains, contained
the most important news he had yet had occasion
to send of the state of himself and his family.</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c001'>“Respected Sir,</p>

<p class='c021'>“I have often thought and called myself bold
in what I have said to you in my letters, but you
have always taken it kindly. This kindness
makes me more bold than ever, especially as to
two things that I am going to write about, when
I have a little explained our present condition.</p>

<p class='c001'>“My employer and I are about to part; which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.107'>107</span>you will be surprised to hear, as there is a full
year remaining of the time I bound myself to
serve. It is through no quarrel, however; Mr.
Stapleton having been a good master to me, unless
for wanting more work out of me than mortal
arm could do; for which, however, he was
always willing to pay me well. The fact is, sir, he
is a daring and a bustling man, such as they say
are always to be found in new countries, wanting,
as soon as they have got all pretty comfortable
about them, to go further into the wilds and begin
again. I see the good of there being such men,
but do not wish to be one; so, when Stapleton
offered me any wages I liked to go with him,
I said ‘No,’ having only engaged to serve him
on this spot; and thus I find myself at liberty a
year sooner than I expected. He offered me an
introduction that would get me good terms
from the gentleman that has taken his pretty
place; but not knowing yet what sort of person
he is, and there being, thank God! far
more work in my way to be done at any price
than I can get through, I wish to keep myself
free. To finish about myself first,—I am building
a sort of double house, in the middle of a
very pretty piece of land. One end of the house
is for myself, and the other for my father, against
his time is up. It would do your heart good,
sir, to see how he has everything comfortable
about him, though he goes on complaining, to
be sure, that this is not the old country. My
step-mother too has succeeded finely with her
fruit this year, and there is as good cider of hers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.108'>108</span>in every cottage as any in Worcestershire, and
such flowers as she grows make the place look
like a paradise.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Allow me now, sir, to go on as if we were
talking as we have often done over the churchyard
gate, or by your door; and not as if this
letter had to travel over the wide sea before it
reaches you. I should like to know whether it
has ever happened to you to fancy gentlemen
like yourself coming over to this place? I am
sure, if such would think of it, it would be the
best thing for the society here, and might prove
so to themselves, in cases where they are not
very well off, and have little to leave that they
care for. You make no secret, sir, of its being
difficult for your family to live on such a curacy
as yours, and you have even talked of settling
your sons abroad as they grow up. If you
would send them,—or (what is better) bring them
here,—they shall be made welcome, and watched
over and taken care of as they ought to be by
those who owe so much to their father. Indeed,
sir, this might prove a pleasant settlement in a
very few years to you and yours. There are
now eleven farms and other dwellings within
three miles, and more building every year; and
Launceston is within reach. The people about
us are mostly very intelligent, and it is a good
sign that they are crying out continually for a
settled clergyman and a school; and, if we cannot
get so much, for a library. You would find
a good house, with a stable, and a horse in it; a
garden, and two or three fields; a school-room
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.109'>109</span>with five-and-twenty scholars, whose parents
would pay you well both for your teaching and
your Sunday services. We should ask you too,
to choose a little library at our expense, and
should add to it, under your direction, every
year; so that your children as well as those of
the settlers should have every advantage. You
will find further particulars of what we can offer
you in the public letter which accompanies this.</p>

<p class='c001'>“My fear is, that the consideration of the young
ladies will deter you, should you otherwise be
disposed to listen to our plan; and, indeed, England
seems at first sight the best place for
daughters that have lost their mother. But I
have great hopes that these plains may be like
an English county before your young ladies have
grown up. When once gentlemen, especially
clergymen, begin to come, more follow; and
this is all we want to make the Dairy Plains
like parts of Sussex or Dorsetshire. We have
specimens of each class, up to the thriving farmer
and wool-grower. There is also a surveyor, and
a surgeon is coming, they say; though he is the
last person wanted, except for an accident now
and then, for we really have no sickness. If, in
addition to these, we could have over a tanner or
two, a coal-master, a vine-grower, a store-keeper,
and so on, each with his proper labourers, ours
would be as flourishing a settlement as any in
the world. There is coal in plenty, and a fine
market in every direction, if we had but people
to work it; and the same may be said of slate,
and bark, and hides. Some Portuguese vine-dressers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.110'>110</span>are making a fine thing of a vineyard
in the south of the island; and why not here,
instead of our having to import spirits in such
quantities as make drunkards of too many of
our labourers? The commoner sorts of wine
we might make would soon drive out spirits, to
our great benefit in every way. As for clothing,
utensils, and other things that are brought to
great perfection and cheapness in England, we
had better go on buying there; and I have no
doubt they will be as glad of our productions
as we of their manufactures. You will be pleased
to hear that there are already twenty-six vessels
belonging to the island, and that upwards of
thirty traded with us from Great Britain last
year; and that 1,000,000 lbs. of wool were sent
there within the twelve months. All these things
I mention to show what a rising country this
is, and how well worth the while of many a
man above the rank of labourers and artizans
to come to. If you should think of doing so,
sir, it would be the best piece of news that could
reach the Dairy Plains from any part of the
world. You should have the heartiest welcome
from some whom you are pleased to call old
friends.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Perhaps, sir, you may remember saying
something to me about the difficulty of getting
a wife here. I have never tried, because there
was one in England, as you know, that I always
hoped might keep herself single till we should
agree that she should follow me out. Through
all these long four years we have had this in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.111'>111</span>view, and now I shall have a house ready for her
by the time she can come; and this is the other
liberty I told you I was about to take. If you
should really come, perhaps, knowing her steadiness
so well, you would let her cross with you,
waiting on the young ladies during the voyage,
for the expense of which I will be answerable.
Whether you join us or not, I have little doubt
you will kindly put her in the way of coming
with the least possible delay; and you may depend
on my meeting her before she lands.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I have said nothing of Ellen, because you
will see her letter to grandfather. I have left it
to her to send money this time, as I have other
use, you see, for my own.</p>

<p class='c001'>“It is a load off my mind, sir, to have written
what has been deep down in it for so long. It
is a great while to wait for an answer; and if
there should be disappointment both ways, I
hardly know how I shall bear it. But I am
pretty sure of what is to me the chief thing; and
if you come too, I wonder what we can manage
to find to wish for next. It pleased God to give
Ellen and me our hardships early, and to take us
out of them before our hearts and tempers were
hurt; like so many at home, better perhaps than
ourselves. If He should try us any more, we
have good reason now to be patient; and in the
meanwhile, we desire to save others from what
we had to go through for a short time, and
therefore write as we do about coming over.</p>

<div class='c022'>”<span class='sc'>Frank Castle.</span></div>

<p class='c001'>“P.S. There are fine downs here for the young
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.112'>112</span>gentlemen to fly their kites, just behind the
house you would have. Ellen will take care that
Miss Maria shall have a pretty poultry-yard;
and Susan is taming an opossum mouse for the
other little lady.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>The many months which necessarily elapsed
before an answer to the above could be received
did indeed seem long; almost as much so to
Frank’s family as to himself. Ellen had made a request
scarcely less important than Frank’s to the
happiness of her parents, if not to her own. She
had always been convinced that the child which
had been sent to the workhouse by the parish
surgeon of A—— was her stepmother’s; and it
had ever been her resolution to yield a sister’s
protection to it. Harry Moore was as willing as
herself to have the child over; and as the boy
was now only five years old, there was hope that
he might prove an exception to the general rule
of the corruption of parish-bred children. Frank’s
betrothed was requested to bring him out with
her; and if Mrs. Castle was still disinclined to
own him, he was to take his place as the eldest
of Harry Moore’s children. There was not a
man, woman, or child in the neighbourhood that
did not see the importance of having a clergyman’s
family come among them; and by all,
therefore, Mr. Jackson’s reply was looked for as
the oracle which was to decide whether their
settlement might immediately rise to that degree
of prosperity which is caused by the union of
high civilization with universal plenty, or whether
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.113'>113</span>it must remain for some time longer in the rude
state which is ever the consequence of a scarcity
of knowledge and of leisure. The parents began
already to teach their children the alphabet and
the multiplication table, during the evenings of
the week, and as many hymns as they could
recollect on Sundays. The little ones already
began to play keeping school; and the travelling
chaplain was told, week by week, how much
pleasanter he would find his occasional visits
when there should be a resident pastor on the
spot, more worthy to converse with him than any
of his flock. A part of the Sunday leisure was
spent by many in repairing to the field where
Mr. Jackson’s house was to be; and then what
planning there was about the garden, and the
stand of bee-hives, and the paddock, and every
other appendage to the parsonage! Some of the
lads were training a pony for the young Jacksons,
and the rarest and finest plants were destined for
their flower-beds.</p>

<p class='c001'>The answer was expected to arrive in May,
and every one hoped it would be before the anniversary;—that
celebration of the arrival of the
emigrants in a land of plenty which has already
been spoken of as the best of their festivals. It
happened to arrive on that very day.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_1.114'>114</span>
  <h3 id='ch1.9' class='c020'><span class='sc'>Chapter IX.</span><br> <br> TRUE CITIZENSHIP.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Bright and busy were the mornings of these
anniversaries;—each busier and brighter than
the last, as the families of the settlers grew in
numbers and prosperity. The labourers and
mechanics who had arrived in the same waggon
with the Castles had found wives or had them
over, and now came thronging with their infants,
bringing also the new comers of their craft, or in
their employ; so that it was found necessary to
spread a greater length of table every year under
the shade where they dined, and to provide a
larger treat of game.</p>

<p class='c001'>There was more bustle than usual this time, from
Stapleton having chosen this very morning for his
departure to the new territory where he meant to
establish a lodge in the wilderness. As it was a
holiday, several neighbours followed in his train
for a few miles; and when obliged to turn back,
gave three cheers to their departing neighbour,
and three to him who was to be his successor in
the abode which had grown up flourishing before
their eyes, and was the chief ornament of their
settlement. Frank joined in these cheers, and
then told his companions that he would follow
them home in an hour, as Mr. Stapleton had
still some more directions to give, and wished
for his company a little farther.—When Frank
reappeared at noon, he looked so grave and had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.115'>115</span>suddenly become so silent that everybody was
struck, and his sister alarmed. He hastily reminded
her that it was post-day; and said he
was going himself to meet the postman, and
would be back before dinner was on table.
Three or four holiday-folks went with him; and
none wondered that he looked grave on hearing
the sentence “No letters for the Dairy
Plains.” Before they were half-way back, some
of the acuter ears among the party caught the
welcome and very rare sound of waggon wheels
in their rear. In course of time, the vehicle
appeared briskly approaching on the Launceston
road, and Frank sprang eagerly forward to gaze
in the faces of the passengers. All were
strange; and these repeated disappointments
left him no heart to hail the travellers. His
companions did so, however; and the reply was
that these were labourers from England, some
bound to Stapleton’s successor, and others on
their way to a settlement further on.</p>

<p class='c001'>“What part of England were they from?”
“Kent and Surrey.” “Did they bring letters for
the Dairy Plains?” “Plenty; and something
besides letters.” So saying, they exhibited a
little boy, the very image of Jerry at five years
old. Frank silently caught him up in his arms,
and carried him on without asking another question;
the dreary conviction having struck him
that as this child was sent alone, none of the
others he wished for were coming.</p>

<p class='c001'>Little passed between himself and Ellen, who
was on the watch.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1.116'>116</span>“Here is the child, Ellen. May he be a
blessing to you!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Is he alone? No letters? No message?
Or worse than none?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“There are letters, but I have not got them
from these people yet. They cannot be good,
you know, or why——”</p>

<p class='c001'>He could not go on. Ellen ran to beg the
particular favour of the travellers to get out the
letters immediately. This was easily done, the
packages of the labourers being small; and
before Frank was called upon to carve for a few
dozen hungry people, he had satisfied himself
that it was very childish and ungrateful to have
been so soon cast down; and his gravity was seen
by those who watched him to be of a very different
character from that which had seized him
three hours before.</p>

<p class='c001'>It was not <a id='corr116.19'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Ellen s'>Ellen’s</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_116.19'><ins class='correction'>Ellen’s</ins></a></span> wish that the little workhouse
child should meet his parents for the first time
in the presence of strangers. Knowing that Castle
and his wife were gathering fruit in their garden,
she took the boy there, (after having brushed the
dust from his clothes, and set him off to the best
advantage,) and put him in at the gate, bidding
him not to be frightened if he was spoken to, but
say where he came from. The little fellow made
no advances. He stood in the middle of the walk,
with a finger of each hand in his mouth, and his
chin upon his breast. He had not yet learned
work-house impudence.</p>

<p class='c001'>Castle was the first to see him, after stooping
so long over his peaches that Ellen began to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.117'>117</span>fear the blindness was wilful. “Wife! Wife!”
she at length heard him call. “He is come!
The boy is come!” Ellen just staid to hear the
words “my boy” from both, and stole away.
The next time she saw him was as he came between
his parents to the dinner table, chattering
in his Kentish dialect, and asking to sit on his
father’s knee, and be treated with fruit by his
mother.</p>

<p class='c001'>“You must be satisfied with being his brother,
Harry,” said Ellen to her husband. “He does
not need to go begging for a father.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Among the toasts which were given after dinner,
some one proposed Mr. Stapleton’s successor,
whose name it was strange enough that nobody
had been able to learn till this day; and perhaps
it was not less remarkable that the name was
the same with that of some respected persons
now present. They would all fill their cans to
the health of Mr. Robert Castle, about to become
their neighbour.</p>

<p class='c001'>It did not seem to occur to anybody who this
Robert Castle was, till the gloom was seen to
have settled over Frank’s countenance as black
as ever. Then the rest of the family looked at
one another in wonder and dismay. Frank’s
companions on either hand asked him if he was
asleep, or what had come over him that he did
not fill his can. He immediately addressed the
party, relating that he had been requested by
Mr. Stapleton to inform the present company
that the proprietor who was coming among them
did not approve of such festivals as they were now
holding; that he had purposely kept away till the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.118'>118</span>present one was over, and hoped to hear of no
more anniversaries.—This announcement occasioned
a great uproar, which Frank quieted by
observing that so absurd an interference as this
need not be regarded otherwise than with silent
contempt; that, whatever reasons the person in
question might have for disliking such a celebration
as theirs, he had nothing to do with the way
in which they chose to remember the country of
their birth, and to be thankful for the blessings
of that in which they now lived. He therefore
proposed, sure of being cheerfully pledged by
every one around him, “Many happy returns to
all present of this remarkable festival.”</p>

<p class='c001'>No wonder Frank had looked grave after bidding
farewell to Stapleton, when the last news he
heard from him was, that his successor was no
other than Bob the convict, whose ambition was
so far gratified that he was able to take on lease
the little estate on which his virtuous elder brother
had till now worked for hire. So much, as
he observed, for his having been favoured with a
free passage! His family were obliged to reconcile
themselves to seeing him climb over their
heads in this way. They reminded one another
that they had made up their minds to the presence
of convicts, as the one great evil attending emigration
to Van Diemen’s Land, and that they
must not now begin to complain because one of
these convicts was a son and brother. What
their intercourse with him was to be, or whether
there was to be any, they left to be decided by
circumstances when he should appear.</p>

<p class='c001'>A hearty welcome being offered to the Kentish
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.119'>119</span>and Surrey folks just arrived, they gave some
account of themselves. They had all suffered
from want of demand for their labour; an evil
which had gone on to increase in the face of the
promises that had been made to them about providing
for all who were out of work on farms
prepared for their advantage alone. A young
labourer from the parish of A—— stated that his
father and mother and their seven children had
been located on such a farm by Mr. Fellowes,
with sixty other families; that it was difficult to
provide for all the young people as they grew up,
and would become more so still when they came
to have families of their own, unless indeed they
spent their whole lives in getting food and food
only. Mr. Fellowes was now anxious to take in
more paupers upon his farm, and was unwilling,
in order to make room for them, to turn out labourers
upon the parish where there were already
too many; and he had therefore advised
the sons and daughters of his home-settlers to
lose no opportunity of getting well placed either
in Canada or Australia. “So,” concluded the
speaker, “I moved off to make room for two elderly
folks, seeing, as Mr. Fellowes himself said, that
I can raise a better living with less toil here than
there, and be much sooner free; and so, here I
am. But Mr. Jackson will tell you all about it,
when he comes, better than I can.”</p>

<p class='c001'>It was now Frank’s turn to explain that the
clergyman and his family were really coming,
and to read that part of his long letter which
concerned the present company.—He had often
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.120'>120</span>thought of coming, the gentleman wrote, and
had nearly made up his mind to it before the invitation
arrived from some of his former flock;
and the inducements held out by them had quite
decided him.—And now what cheering, what
long and loud congratulation followed!</p>

<p class='c001'>“What are you shaking your head for, Castle?”
inquired one who sat opposite to him.
“You cannot altogether help smiling; so why
spoil sport with shaking your head? What are
you sorry for?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I am not sorry. I am very glad. I am
only afraid of Mr. Jackson’s growing sorry, and
that in a very little while. After all, you see,
this is not the old country.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“No more is the coat on your back an old
coat; and how is it the worse for that?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Tush! Stuff! One’s coat has nothing to
do with one’s happiness, as one’s country has.
England is one’s home after all.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Not mine, I am sure. It was a dreary
place enough to me,—nothing like a home. I
and mine were neglected or oppressed at every
turn; not because anybody meant us harm; but
like starving people who happen to be just so
many more than are needed. Here I have all I
want without begging or returning thanks; and
this is my home. Wherever I have a dwelling
and food, wherever I have comfort and safety
within doors, and can step abroad among friends,
there is my home. Put me under a parish roof
in the very spot I was born in, and I should feel
like a banished man. Set me down independent,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.121'>121</span>with my family about me, in any part of the
world,—in the middle of a forest or on the
wildest sea-shore, and, be it north, south, east,
or west, that place is a home to me.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Castle still shook his head, saying that there
was no place like England to an Englishman.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Aye; if you could be as well off in England
as you are here, I grant you. But just answer
me this,—if you and your family could be set
down this very day before the workhouse at A—,
in the condition in which you drove away from it,
would you go?”</p>

<p class='c001'>Castle stole a glance at his children and hesitated
to reply.—To spare his father, Frank observed
that Mr. Jackson had a good deal to say
on this subject, and proceeded to finish the letter,
the auditory showing by their silence during its
progress and their enthusiasm at its conclusion,
that they were partly sensible of the greatness of
the occasion, as well as prepared to enter into his
opinions and feelings. Several of them, besides
Frank and others who personally knew Mr. Jackson,
felt that a new era in the prosperity of the
settlement at Dairy Plains was likely to begin
from this day;—for their correspondent might
be said to be already among them.</p>

<p class='c001'>After discussing the details of his removal, his
letter proceeded thus:—</p>

<p class='c001'>“My first consideration was, as you suppose,
for my children; and long and anxiously did I
consider, as it will be a comfort to as many of
you as have families to know. The only way to
settle such a question is, to ascertain what are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.122'>122</span>the objects of human life. This done, it is easy
to settle where those objects may be best attained.
What I desire for my sons and daughters is that
life should train them to the greatest degree of
benevolence and integrity, out of which is sure
to spring the highest kind of piety; and these
things, with outward plenty, make happiness.
Now, it seems to me that that benevolence is of
the most kindly and abundant sort which subsists
among happy people; and that integrity is most
secure where the interests of all are the same,
instead of being opposed. I think that not all
the advantages of society and what is commonly
called education, which my children could have
in England, will set against the freedom from
temptation and from the corrupting sights of
human misery which must there come in their
way; poor as they must be here, and condemned
to jostle their way in the world, and probably to
lose a step or two of the rank which their father’s
profession leads them to consider as their own.
Education is made up of many things besides
books, and even cultivated society; and I am
much mistaken if, with such a field of exertion
before them, and such motives to it, with abundance
of God’s blessings and beauties poured out
around them, in the midst of an affectionate and
thriving people, and with their father at hand to
teach much which they could not otherwise learn,
the intellects of my sons and daughters may not
become of a much higher order than they could
amidst the struggle for subsistence which they
must sustain at home. I judge for none but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.123'>123</span>those who are circumstanced like myself; but I
certainly feel that those who have several children
for whom they can provide nothing more than
that sort of education which will not be of use to
them in a competition for bread, are the right
persons to go abroad and make their home where,
at the sacrifice of some of the privileges of high
civilization, none of the troubles and moral evils
of poverty can enter.</p>

<p class='c001'>“You will have heard that Mr. Fellowes finds his
well-meant plans somewhat difficult to manage,
from the vast increase of claimants. I believe
he still thinks that if there were People’s Farms
enough, the relief might be made effectual, though
he cannot explain what is to be done with so
many delvers a hundred years hence, and will
not say whether we are all to become delvers and
spinners rather than a few of us cross the world
to a more fruitful land. Your grandparents seem
to like their settlement on his farm, and their
employment of looking after some of the orphan
children, and teaching them to dig and spin.
Your presents and Ellen’s give them great pleasure,
and add to their stock of little comforts.
They sigh for you sometimes; and no wonder:
but they console themselves with saying that
your father will end his days among a thriving
set of grandchildren who need never fear want.
Mr. Fellowes is glad, I am pleased to see, to
have some of his farm labourers go abroad as
opportunity offers; and some of these will convey
this letter to you.—So many inquiries have
already been addressed to me since my determination
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.124'>124</span>was known, that I have strong hopes
that persons of various classes will soon be on
their way to the Dairy Plains.—Wherever colonization
has succeeded best, the emigrating
party has been composed of specimens of every
rank and class; so that no one felt stripped of
the blessings of the mother-country, but rather
that he moved away in the midst of an entire
though small society. If gentlemen go to one
place, and labourers to another, the settlement is
sure to pine, like that at the Swan River, and
like too many more of the same kind. Whatever
expense and trouble may be incurred in locating
such imperfect materials of society must be well
nigh lost. The true economy, the true benevolence,
the true wisdom, of emigration is to send
out a company as a swarm of bees goes forth,—under
proper leaders, and in a state of organization.
This is the doctrine I declare as often
as I am questioned; and I am trying to convince
such capitalists as talk of emigrating that, if done
in such a mode as this, their removal becomes
most like a removal from one county to another;—as
if they went from Norfolk into Cumberland,
or from Lancashire into the new scenery of
Devonshire. Let us hope that some of them
will make the trial.</p>

<p class='c001'>“The greatest surprise to me is that some still
go on talking of its being unpatriotic to leave
one’s country. Surely it is patriotic to do whatever
most benefits one’s country; and it is
pretty clear that it is a benefit to rid ours of
thousands of her burdensome children, to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.125'>125</span>great advantage, instead of injury, of her <a id='corr125.1'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='colonies'>colonies.</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_125.1'><ins class='correction'>colonies.</ins></a></span>
After all, a state is made up of individual members;
and, therefore, whatever most benefits those
individuals must benefit the state. Our duty to
the state and our duty to ourselves are not opposing
duties; if they were, there would either be
no patriots, or no one would thrive. On the
contrary, a man’s chief duty to his country is to
provide honestly and abundantly, if he can, for
himself and his family; and when this cannot
be done at home, it is a breach of duty to stay
and eat up other men’s substance there, if a
living can be had <a id='corr125.13'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='eleswhere'>elsewhere</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_125.13'><ins class='correction'>elsewhere</ins></a></span>. But I need not
argue this matter with you, who have seen and
adopted the true patriotism. I and mine will
come and try what we can do to make the name
of our native land honoured in distant regions as
it is in our own hearts: and when the reckoning
comes to be made of what, as a community, we
of the Dairy Plains have done for the state of
which we are members, let it be clear that we
have loved and served her all the better for being
removed from the gates of her workhouses into
one of the palaces which God himself has built
for her.”</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_1.126'>126</span>
  <h3 class='c013'><i>Summary of Principles illustrated in this Volume.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c023'>Two kinds of colonization have been adopted
by the British Empire;—Colonization for the
reduction of our home-population,—or Voluntary
Emigration;—and Penal Colonization.</p>

<p class='c001'>The term Colonization is by some applied to
a third process, which they wish to see introduced
into this country; viz.—Home Colonization.</p>

<p class='c001'>The objects of Voluntary Emigration, directed
by the state, are threefold.</p>

<p class='c001'>1st. To improve the condition of those who
emigrate, by placing them where they may obtain
subsistence at less cost than at home.</p>

<p class='c001'>2d. To improve the condition of those who
remain, by increasing the ratio of capital to population.</p>

<p class='c001'>3d. To improve the condition of the colonized
region.</p>

<p class='c001'>To fulfil the 1st of these objects, the colony
must be so located as to insure health and abundance
to its members; and it must be so organized
as to secure the due co-operation of labour
and capital.</p>

<p class='c001'>To fulfil the 2d object, the removal of each
individual must be less costly than his maintenance
at home would be; and the selection must
be made with a view to lessening the amount of
human productiveness at home.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1.127'>127</span>To fulfil the 3d object, the colonists must be
selected with a view to their productiveness,
both as regards capital and population; which
includes a moral fitness to compose an orderly
society.</p>

<p class='c001'>It follows from all these considerations that a
new settlement should be composed of young,
healthy, and moral persons; that all should not
be labourers, nor all capitalists; and that there
should be a sufficient concentration of their
numbers on the new lands to insure a facility of
exchanges.</p>

<p class='c024'>Home colonies may afford a temporary relief
to a redundant population, and also increase the
productiveness of the lands which they appropriate;
but this is done by alienating capital
from its natural channels; and with the certainty
of ultimately injuring society by increasing the
redundancy of population over capital.</p>

<p class='c001'>Home colonization then, though less injurious
than the unproductive distribution of the Charity-fund,
is inferior to foreign colonization, inasmuch
as the one yields temporary benefit to a few at
the expense of ultimate injury to many; and the
other produces permanent benefit to all.</p>

<p class='c024'>The objects of Penal Colonization are,</p>

<p class='c001'>1st. The security of society by the removal of
the offender.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1.128'>128</span>2d. The security of society by the effect of his
example.</p>

<p class='c001'>3d. The reformation of the offender.</p>

<p class='c001'>There has hitherto been an entire failure of all
these objects. And no wonder; since,</p>

<p class='c001'>1st. The offender is only transferred from one
portion of society to another: and besides, frequently
returns to his old haunts.</p>

<p class='c001'>2d. His punishment, as far as it is punishment,
takes place at too great a distance to be conspicuous
as a warning; and in as far as his lot
does not involve punishment, the effect of his
example is precisely the reverse of what is
desired.</p>

<p class='c001'>3d. Our convict arrangements tend to the
further corruption of the offender, by letting him
experience a great improvement in his condition
as a direct consequence of his crimes.</p>

<p class='c001'>The junction of penal with voluntary emigration
tends equally to disappoint the purposes
of the one, and to extinguish the benefits of the
other; since convict labourers find themselves in
a state of privilege, in a region where their
labour procures them large rewards; and new
settlers find their community deeply injured by
the vice and disease consequent on the introduction
of a convict population.</p>

<h3 id='ch2.1' class='c025'><span class='sc'>Chapter I.</span><br> <br> NOVELTY.</h3>

<p class='c017'>The season was more than half over, and was
about to be pronounced remarkably dull, when a
promise of novelty was given out in the shape of
a rumour that lord F—— and his lady, who had
been travelling abroad from the day of their
marriage, had arrived in town, and that the bride’s
first appearance would take place at the Duke of
A——’s ball on the 20th. This information was
circulated in various forms of words, all bearing
a relation to what lady F—— had been before
she was lady F——. At the clubs, in the shops,
in drawing-rooms and boudoirs, it was related
that lady F——’s debut would take place on the
20th. Her first appearance on a new stage,—her
return from a tour in the provinces,—her
first night in a new character, all were referred
to the 20th, in a manner which should prevent
any one forgetting that lady F—— had quitted
a profession on her marriage. The curiosity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.2'>2</span>was not confined to mothers and daughters, to
whose observation an extraordinary marriage is
the most exciting circumstance that life affords:
in this case, the interest was shared by their
husbands and fathers. Some wondered how the
proud old earl would stand the introduction of
his daughter-in-law into his own society; and
others, who had told lord F—— that he was a
lucky fellow to have won such a glorious creature,
speculated, notwithstanding, on the awkwardnesses
and difficulties which must hourly
arise from the choice of one so far below him in
rank. He was an odd personage, however,—lord
F——; and there was no telling how he
would think and feel on occasions when everybody
else felt alike. On the whole, greater
sympathy was expressed for his sister, lady
Frances, who was more likely to be mortified,—who
certainly was more mortified at the connexion
than the rest of her family. Her father
was understood to have insisted on her making
the best of the affair, since it could not be helped;
but, whatever her outward demeanour might
appear, it would be too hard upon her to suppose
that she could do more than barely keep on
terms with a sister-in-law who had been on the
stage. A solitary voice here and there reminded
the speculators how it was that lady F—— had
adopted a profession, and asked whether the connexion
would have been thought very preposterous
if she had been known only as the highly
educated daughter of an eminent merchant; or
whether the marvellousness of the case rested on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.3'>3</span>her father’s misfortunes, and her choice of a way
of life when he was no longer living to support
and protect her: but these questions met with no
other answer than that such a marriage was so
very strange an one that the speculators longed
to see how all the parties carried it off; though,
to be sure, such beauty as lady F——’s went a
great way towards making the thing easy;—almost
as far as her husband’s carelessness of the
opinion of the world.—Meanwhile, who had seen
her riding in the park? Was she more or less
beautiful than on the stage? Was lady Frances
with her? Who had called, and who had not?
How was it to be the fashion to treat her? And
so forth.</p>

<p class='c001'>How much did all this signify to lord and lady
F——, to the earl, and to lady Frances? The
bride fancied little, and feared nothing. She had
been conversant with many ranks of society, and
had found them all composed of men and women;
and she never doubted that in that with which
she was about to become acquainted, she should
also have to deal with men and women. Her
husband guessed what speculations were going
on, and did not care for them. The earl also
knew, and did care, as did lady Frances; but
they disposed differently of their anxieties; the
earl repressing them in order to the best disposition
of circumstances which he could not prevent;
his daughter allowing them to fill her mind,
appear in her manners, and form a part of her
conversation with her intimate friends.</p>

<p class='c001'>Lady F—— and her husband dined alone on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.4'>4</span>the day of the Duke of A——’s ball. As the
bride entered her dressing-room, she met her
lady’s-maid fidgeting about near the door.</p>

<p class='c001'>“O, dear, my lady,” said Philips, “I am
glad you are come. I was just going to take the
liberty of venturing to send Thérèse, to remind
your ladyship how very late it is growing. It
would scarcely be justice, either to myself or
your ladyship, to cramp us for time in our first
toilet; and I was not able so much as to lay out
your dress; for Thérèse was so idle, I find, as
not to have ascertained what your ladyship intends
to wear.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I have been so idle as not to have made up
my own mind yet, Philips. There is abundance
of time, however, if you are no longer dressing
my hair than Thérèse and I shall be about the
rest.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Philips immediately looked very solemn; and
though the toilet lamps were duly lighted, and all
was ready for her operations, she stood with her
arms by her side, in the attitude of waiting.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, Philips, I am ready.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Will you please, my lady, to send Thérèse
and her work elsewhere? It cannot be expected
that I should exhibit my ways so as a mere
novice may supplant me any day, my lady.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“This is Thérèse’s proper place, and here she
shall stay,” replied the lady. “However, she
shall read to us; and then, you know, she cannot
be a spy upon your doings.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Thérèse read accordingly till the hair was
dressed. At the first pause, Philips observed that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.5'>5</span>she must brush up her French, her fluency in
which she had lost from having missed the advantage
of visiting Paris last year.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Thérèse will be obliged to any one who will
talk with her in her own tongue, Philips. Suppose,
instead of having fancies about supplanting
one another, you make the best use you can of
each other, since you must be a good deal
together.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I will do my best, I am sure, my lady, to
instruct the girl in all that relates to her own
sphere, without encroaching on mine. I will do
my best to reform her dress, which really bespeaks
her to be a green-grocer’s daughter, if I may
venture to say so. But as to dressing hair,—allow
me to appeal to lady Frances whether it
can be expected that I should disseminate my
principles out of my own sphere.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“See who knocks, Thérèse.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The earl and lady Frances were below, and
lady Frances would be particularly glad to speak
to Mrs. Philips, if not engaged with my lady.
Mrs. Philips, at her lady’s desire, went to receive
her late mistress’s commands, and Thérèse enacted
the lady’s-maid, as she had done from the
time she had left Paris in lady F——’s train.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Come, Thérèse, let us have done before anybody
arrives to criticise us novices. How nervous
you look, child! What is the difference between
dressing me to-day and any other day?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“There is no toilet in travelling, madame,—no
fêtes like this; and in the inns there was so
much less grandeur than here. I have not been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.6'>6</span>educated to serve you, like Mrs. Philips, or to
live in a great house.—I am more fit to sew for
you, madame, or read to you, than to help you
instead of Mrs. Philips.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I do not want two Mrs. Philipses, you
know; and as for the grandeur you speak of,—if
we do not find it comfortable, we will have done
with it. What have we too much of,—of light,
or of warmth, or of drawers and dressing boxes,
or of books? You like old china, and I like old
pictures, and here are both. Which of all these
things do you wish away?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“O, none of them, I dare say, when I grow
used to them: but they are so little like my
father’s house! I felt the inns very grand at
first, but they are bare and tarnished, compared
with what we have here.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes. You would have been glad of such a
rug as this under your feet in those cold rooms
at Amiens; and I should have liked such a mirror
as this instead of one so cracked, that one half of
my face looked as if it could not possibly fit the
other. I see much to like and nothing to be
afraid of in rugs and mirrors.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You, madame, no! You are made to have
the best of everything come to you of its own
accord; and you know how to use everything.
You....”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And yet, Thérèse, I was once as poor as
you, and poorer. If I know how to use things,
and if, as you say, they come to me of the best,
it is because I think first what they were made
for, and not what they are taken as signs of. If,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.7'>7</span>instead of enjoying the luxuries of my house, I
were to look upon them as showing that I am
lady F——, I should be apt to try to behave as
people think lady F—— should behave; and
then I should be awkward. Now, if you consider
all the pretty things you have to use, not as
pointing you out as lady F——’s lady’s-maid,
but as intended to make me and my little friend
comfortable, you will not be distressed about
being unlike Philips: you will know that I had
rather see you the same Thérèse that I always
knew you.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“O, madame, this is being very good. But
then, I cannot feel as you do, because there is
more occasion for me to think about the change.
There is my lord to take off your thoughts from
such things; he is with you in every new place,
and you see how accustomed he is to everything
that is strange to you.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“That does make some difference certainly,”
said the lady, smiling, “but then you should
consider how many more new places and people
I have to make acquaintance with than you.
Except Philips, or two or three of the servants
below, you have nobody to be afraid of, and I am
never long away. You will feel yourself at ease
in one room after another, and with one person
after another, till you will learn to do all your
business, and speak all your thoughts, as simply
and confidently as you once watered the salads
in your father’s shop, and made your confession
to good old father Bénoit.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Thérèse sighed deeply, as she finished her task
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.8'>8</span>and withdrew to the fireside, as if no longer to
detain her lady about her own affairs.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I have not forgotten, Thérèse, about finding
a confessor for you. I am only cautious lest we
should not observe exactly your father’s directions.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Madame—they are so very particular!—that
the priest should be a devout man, and very
old and experienced in the confession of girls
like me.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I know; and we thought we had found such
an one; but he has forgotten almost all his
French, and you could hardly confess in English.
But make yourself easy; your conscience shall
soon be relieved.—Good night. Philips will sit
up.... More work, do you want?—You may
give Philips a French lesson. O, you have read
all these books. Well: come with me into the
library, and I will find you more.”</p>

<p class='c001'>On the stairs they met lord F——.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Where are you going, Letitia? Frances is
closeted with Philips in the library.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Thérèse immediately stole back to the dressing-room;
but before the carriages drove off, she
was furnished with a fresh volume wherewith to
be occupied when she should have made tea for
Mrs. Philips and herself.</p>

<p class='c001'>The earl had dreaded lest he should find Letitia
nervous at the prospect of the formidable evening
she was about to pass. His visit was meant to
reassure her, and she understood the kindness of
the intention, and showed that she did. When
lady Frances came in from her conference with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.9'>9</span>Philips, she found them side by side on the sofa,—Letitia
quiet and self-possessed, and the earl
regarding her with as much admiration as kindness.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I am sure you may be obliged to me for
giving up Philips to you,” said lady Frances to
Letitia. “She has dressed you beautifully to-night.
Is not she a treasure?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“A great treasure to you, Frances,” said her
brother, “so pray take her back again. Letitia
has one treasure of a maid in her dressing-room
already, and it is a pity she should rob you of
yours.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Indeed it is,” said lady F——. “Philips’s
accomplishments are thrown away upon me, I
am afraid. If you will allow her to give my little
French girl a few lessons, I shall be just as
much obliged to you, and shall not deprive you
of your servant.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Lady Frances protested; but her brother was
peremptory, to her utter astonishment, for she
had never known him speak of lady’s maids
before, and would not have believed that he could
ever learn one from another. She did not perceive
that he did not choose that his wife’s beauty
should be attributed to the art of her toilet.</p>

<p class='c001'>Not the slightest trace of trepidation was
observable in the bride when she alighted from
her carriage, when her name was shouted up the
staircase, or when all who were within hearing
turned to gaze as she entered the crowded saloon,
leaning on the arm of the earl. There was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.10'>10</span>something much more like girlish glee than fear
in her countenance; for, the truth was, Letitia
had a taste for luxury, as all simple-minded persons
would have, if their simplicity extended as
far as a disregard of the factitious associations by
which luxury is converted into an incumbrance.
Having been early accustomed to so much of it
as to excite the taste, then deprived of it, then
baulked and tantalized with the coarse and tinsel
imitation of it which had met her during her
short professional course, it was with lively pleasure
that she now greeted the reality. The
whole apparatus of festivity inspired her with
instantaneous joy:—the bowers of orange and
rose trees, light, warmth and music together, the
buzz of voices, and above all the chalked floor,—all
these set her spirits dancing. A single
glance towards her husband told him enough to
have placed him perfectly at ease respecting the
affairs of the evening, even if he had been a man
who could be otherwise than at his ease. He
knew perfectly well that it was impossible for
any one of good sense and taste not to admire
and respect Letitia, and he cared little under
what pretence others might depreciate her accomplishments.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Lady F—— is the star of the night, as every
one is observing,” said an old friend of the earl’s,
who was absorbed in watching the dancers,
among whom was Letitia. “The brightest star,
we all agree, and shining as if in her native
sphere.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2.11'>11</span>“This is her native sphere,” replied the earl.
“She is in her own sphere wherever there is
grace, wherever there is enjoyment.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“True: so young, so simple as she appears!
She seems perfectly unspoiled.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Perfectly. She has gone through too much
to be easily spoiled. Change,—anything more
than modification—is impossible in her case, do
with her what you will. You are an old friend,
and I have no objection to let you see that I am
proud of Letitia.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I am truly glad.... I felt uncertain....
I did not know....”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Nor I till to-night,” said the earl, smiling.
“But I find I have no more wish than right to
question my son’s choice.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But you must expect the world to criticise
it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Certainly. If my son acts so as to imply
contempt of conventional marriages, there will be
contempt cast on his marriage of love. If both
parties carry off their contempt inoffensively,
both are welcome to their opinions.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well! there are many here whose parents
have had occasion to use your philosophy, or
some other to answer the same purpose.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Lady F—— is the star of the night,” observed
lady Frances’s partner, gazing at Letitia
through his glass. “Peerless indeed!”</p>

<p class='c001'>Lady Frances made no answer, which emboldened
the gentleman to proceed.</p>

<p class='c001'>“The star of the night, as she has often been
called, and never more justly. Never, in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.12'>12</span>proudest moment of her glory, was she more
lovely.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Still lady Frances was silent.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Perhaps your ladyship feels this to be the
night of her glory; and, indeed, it is a triumph
to have risen, through her own radiance, into a
higher sphere.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I question whether she feels it so,” replied
lady Frances. “Letitia is very proud, and her
pride takes rather an odd turn. She would tell
you that she considers it a condescension to come
among us, who are only born to our station.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Surprising! And what inspired her condescension?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“O, love, of course; pure love. Nothing
else could have prevailed with her to submit to
marriage. You should hear her talk of the
condition of wives,—how she pitied all till she
became one herself. You cannot conceive what
poor slaves she thinks them.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And what says lord F——?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“He is fired by her eloquence. You have no
idea how eloquent she is. She pours it out as
if....”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It was in her heart, as well as by heart.
How will she keep it up, now she has no practice?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“They will have private theatricals down at
Weston, I have no doubt.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I beseech your ladyship’s interest to get me
invited. It will be such a new thing to see lord
F—— on the stage. Of course he will play the
heroes to his wife’s heroines. Whatever may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.13'>13</span>have been hitherto, he will scarcely like, I should
think ... he is scarcely the man.... Faith!
if she is proud and high-spirited, as you say, she
has met her match.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Lady Frances smiled; and as she was led
away to supper, assured her partner that nothing
could be pleasanter than the terms they were all
on with lady F——; for she was, after all, a
noble creature; which information was received
with a deferential bow.</p>

<p class='c001'>In every group of talkers, lady F——’s merits
were canvassed. Some ladies would give any
thing in the world for her courage, till reminded
by their mammas that she had been trained to
self-confidence, when they suddenly became contented
with their own timidity. Others would
have supposed her not out of her teens, by the
girlish enjoyment she seemed to feel; but these
were reminded that this kind of scene was as
new to her as if she had not been seen and heard
of in public for nearly four years. Everybody
agreed that she was beautiful, and very amiable,
and astonishingly simple, and conducting herself
with wonderful propriety: and everybody admired
the good-natured earl’s manner towards
her, and wondered whether it was lady Frances’s
own choice to come with her, and conjectured
what lord F——’s happiness must be to witness
his bride’s flattering welcome to the rank he had
given her.</p>

<p class='c001'>Lord F——’s happiness, though as great as
these kind friends could wish, was not altogether
of the character they supposed.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2.14'>14</span>“You have enjoyed yourself, Letitia,” he observed,
as they were going home in the grey of
the morning, and when she made the first pause
in her remarks to let down the glass, as a market
cart, laden with early vegetables and flowers,
passed for a few moments alongside the carriage.</p>

<p class='c001'>“How sweet!—O how sweet those violets
are!” she exclaimed, as a whiff of fragrance was
blown in. “Enjoyed myself! Yes,—it is a new
page,—quite a new page of human history to
me.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Your passion is for turning over such pages.
What next?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“If I had a market-woman’s cloak and bonnet,
I should like to step into that cart and go to
Covent-Garden, to see the people dressing it up
against sunrise. I should like, some morning,
to go into the city when the sun is just touching
the steeples, and see life waken up in the streets.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I wonder you did not stand in the door-way
to-night,” said her husband, smiling, “to see
the contrast between speculating life on the
pavement and polished life in the saloon.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I saw enough, without standing in the door-way,”
replied Letitia, gravely. “It was more
different than I had supposed from something of
the same kind that I had seen often enough
before. I had seen the great and the humble
throng about our theatre doors; but then there
was room for each, though far apart. All went
to share a common entertainment,—to be happy
at the same time, though not side by side. Here
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.15'>15</span>there were peers within and paupers without;
careless luxury above, and withering hardship
below. This is too deep a page for my reading,
Henry; and not the easier for my having been
in both conditions myself.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Why wish then for more experience, till you
have settled this matter?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Because we cannot tell, till we have tried,
what we may find in any matter to throw light
upon any other matter.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Suppose you should find all wrapped in
darkness at last, as Faust did when he had gratified
his passion for experience.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Impossible,—having Faust before me for a
warning. He kindled his altar fire from below
when the sun was high, and he let somebody put
it out when both sun and moon were gone down.
Where was the use of his burning-glass then?
How should he be otherwise than dark?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“True; but how would you manage better?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I would never quit stability for a moment.
Faust found out that the world rolled round continually.
He jumped to the conclusion that there
was no such thing in nature as a firm footing,
and so cast himself off into perdition. If he had
taken his walks in God’s broad sunshine, he
would have found that the ground did not give
way under him, nor ever would, till he was etherealized
enough to stand on air.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“So instead of speculating on the incompatibilities
of human happinesses, and concluding that
there is no such thing as a common welfare, you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.16'>16</span>would make trial of all conditions, and deduce
the summum bonum from your experience.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes; that is the way; and if you would
help me, the thing would be done twice as well.
If we were each to go a pilgrimage through the
ranks of society, (for we would settle the affairs
of the moral world before we began upon the
natural,)....”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Very reasonably, certainly,” replied her
husband, smiling, “since it is easier to get into
palaces and hovels, than into thunder-clouds and
sea-caves.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well;—if you began at the top and I
at the bottom, if we were to meet in the middle,
I do think we might see how all might
dance amidst fragrance and music, and none
lean starving on the frosty area-rails. You
should be king, minister, peer, and so on, down
to a tradesman; and I would be a friendless
Italian boy with his white mouse, and a pauper,
and a cotton-spinner, and a house-servant, and
so upwards, till I met you at the tradesman’s we
spoke of.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“My dear, why do you put yourself at the
bottom instead of me?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Because you would be longer in learning
what to make of poverty than I. I know a
good deal about it already, you are aware.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Since we cannot rove up and down as we will
through the mazes of society, Letitia, we will do
what we can by varying our occupations. Variety
of research may partly stand in the stead of migration
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.17'>17</span>from rank to rank.—You spoke at random,
just now, of my being minister. What
would you say if I were to become a servant of
the crown;—that is, in other words, a servant of
the people?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“That I would serve you,—O how humbly,
how devotedly!—as the servant of the people,”
cried Letitia, colouring high. “You know....”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I know that in marrying me you dreaded,
above all things, falling into the routine of aristocratic
idleness. I know that you felt it a
sacrifice to surrender your public service and
influence; and this is one reason among many,
Letitia, why I should like to accept office;—that
you might espouse another kind of public
service in espousing me. But here we are at
home. I shall be able to tell you more after
dinner to-morrow than I know at present of this
matter.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Letitia’s experience of this day was not yet
over. She found it very painful to be undressed
by a yawning, winking lady’s-maid; and she resolved
that her engagements should never more
deprive Mrs. Philips of her natural rest, however
lady Frances might teach Mrs. Philips herself to
laugh at the absurdity of a lady of rank troubling
herself to lay aside her own trappings.</p>

</div>

<p class='c017'>Lady F——’s “experience” might have been
of a very different kind from that which now lay
in her way, if her regard to “stability” had
been less. When very young,—at the period of
her father’s misfortunes and death,—she had been
strongly tempted to marry Mr. Waldie, a merchant,
who was thought by the few friends of the
destitute girl to have done her great honour by
offering her his hand at such a crisis, and to have
proved the disinterestedness of his attachment in
a way which should have ensured it a better
return. Letitia refused him, however; giving to
her protectors the very sufficient reason that she
did not love Mr. Waldie; and keeping to herself
the further justification that she had no confidence
in the steadiness of his principles and conduct.
His impulses were generous, but fitful;
and there was an excitement about him which
had never yet been absorbed by any pursuit, or
allayed by any possession. This might take any
turn as he grew older,—either benevolent or
selfish. It might be philanthropy,—but it
might also be wine, billiards, roving, or many
other things which would involve the slavery of
his wife;—and Letitia, unblinded by passion,
was able to perceive that there is little enough of
rational freedom at the best in the condition of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.19'>19</span>wife, and that a woman’s only hope of that which
the marriage law at present denies her rests in
the steady principle as well as the enlightened
views of her husband. Her friends soon after
exclaimed against Mr. Waldie’s fickleness in a
case which did not, in her opinion, testify fickleness
of affection so much as rashness of conduct.
He offered (as soon as he found his cause hopeless
with Letitia) to her elder sister; and Maria,
being really, and having been long, attached to
him, married him, not unwarned by her sister of
the tendency of his failings. The tenderest
affection henceforth subsisted between the
sisters. Maria was full of gratitude to Letitia
for having refused Mr. Waldie; and Letitia
was full of respectful compassion for Maria when
she witnessed her devotion to her husband, and
could not stifle the conviction that that husband’s
first affection had not died out the more rapidly
for being too suddenly repressed. Maria was
satisfied that she had as much of Mr. Waldie’s
affection as he would ever have to bestow on one
permanent object; and that she was much happier
than she could ever have been without him;
so that she called herself, and all who spoke on
the matter called her, a very fortunate wife.</p>

<p class='c001'>Mr. Waldie had begun life as a rich man.
His business was almost as considerable as any
in the city; his abode on the Surrey side of
London was elegant, and beautifully situated,
and he kept two carriages. The wonder had
been, during all the four years of Letitia’s professional
career, why so rich a brother-in-law
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.20'>20</span>should have allowed her to live by any such
means. Mr. Waldie incessantly and truly pleaded
that he could not help it; and much was said of
her unconquerable love of the fine arts, and of
the eccentricities into which her passion for independence
led her. The sisters knew of very
good reasons besides these why Letitia should
not submit to live on the bounty of a brother-in-law,
even if he were as generous as Mr. Waldie;
and when the matter ended in Letitia becoming
lady F——, her eccentricities met with all due
respect.</p>

<p class='c001'>Lady Frances never could conceive why Letitia
called her present life an idle one, and
seemed to think entertaining her sister’s children
the most serious business she had. Lady Frances
thought no life so busy as that of persons of
rank during the season. For her part, she saw
tradespeople loiter about much more than she
had time to do. Did not the baker’s man stop
for a few minutes’ talk with the kitchen-girl in
the area? Were not fishmongers seen leaning
with folded arms against their stalls? Did not
shopmen read newspapers behind the counter,
and merchants’ clerks stop in the Strand to look
at caricatures? All this while, ladies of her rank
never could get through all the shopping they
planned for a morning, unless they gave up one
or two of the exhibitions; and nobody ever went
down Regent-street in such a hurry as lord B.
or the duke of C.; unless it was the newsman
or letter-carrier. She, for one, had been intending
for weeks to call on poor old lady Y., and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.21'>21</span>had never found time; while Letitia, who had
such superior tastes too, complained (if you
asked her) that she had not enough to do.
With her books, and her harp, and her singing,—she
was very careful to keep up her singing,—with
all these in addition to her “social duties,”
so engrossing during the season, one would have
thought she had had enough on her hands; but
she had asked her husband to read German with
her; and they actually sat down, like school
children, with a dictionary between them, every
morning before his lordship went out. Moreover,
she was polishing up her little French girl,—perhaps
for a governess for her sister’s children.
Very sweet children those were; and it
was natural that Letitia should love them, as
being her sister’s; but it seemed really to be
giving up too much to them to refuse a sweet
spring ride to Hampton Court, because she had
promised to take the little things into the park
with her, that particular day. The worst of it
was, Letitia was infecting her husband with this
notion of not having enough to do. He....</p>

<p class='c001'>“You will hear no more of that,” quietly observed
the earl. “Henry will have quite enough
on his hands henceforward. He has accepted
office.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Poor Letitia!” exclaimed lady Frances,
laughing. “She will have more time hanging
heavy than ever, unless, indeed, Henry makes
her his private secretary.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“He might do worse,” observed the earl.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.22'>22</span>“And, proud as you think Henry, he will not
disdain to let his wife cast many lights into the
affairs he is taking in hand. If he knows most
of the theory and practice of trade, she has had
the most to do with individual and social character.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Of course, sir, as she had to make human
nature a professional study. When Henry has
to do with bonds and liabilities, she can enact
Portia; when he studies insurance, she will find
something à propos in the Tempest; and she
must have many a fine smuggling scene at her
tongue’s end.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“True. It is a happy thing for a man of
business, as Henry will find, to have an accomplished
wife to lighten and recompense his toil.”</p>

<p class='c001'>This was one of the many thoughts in lord
F——’s mind when he sought Letitia to tell her
that the negociation was concluded, and that he
was to take office immediately. He found her
and Thérèse in the music-room, busy with the
three little Waldies. The youngest was sitting
on the table, clutching aunt Letitia’s curls, while
she was explaining to the eldest what Bewick’s
old man was doing in the churchyard. The
second kneeled on Thérèse’s lap, babbling
French, of which she knew about as much as of
English. A charming discord of sweet sounds
greeted lord F——’s ears as he entered the
room. The “Da, da, da,” of the baby; the
coqueting in French about a kiss between
Thérèse and her charge; and the anxious questions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.23'>23</span>and explanations of the two engaged upon
Bewick, made the uncle prefer looking on in
silence, till Letitia turned to him with,</p>

<p class='c001'>“It will not do. We must give it up at present.
There is no making little children understand
about old age, and death, and churchyards.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The child turned her frowning face upon her
uncle, as if appealing to him for light. He
could not but try. He found she had seen Brixton
church, seen something there this very
morning; whether a wedding or a funeral, it
required some time to find out; and this involved
a description of each. Then came the question,</p>

<p class='c001'>“Why are people white when they are married,
and black when they are buried?”</p>

<p class='c001'>In the middle of the explanation, she turned
to the picture,</p>

<p class='c001'>“Is that little boy with his hoop going to be
buried? Is that old man going to be buried?”</p>

<p class='c001'>No: they were neither of them dead yet; but
the old man would be before very long, for he
was very, very old....</p>

<p class='c001'>“Then, was he rather new once?”</p>

<p class='c001'>Uncle could no longer keep so grave as the subject
required, and besides, did not know how to
convey that old and new would not do in all cases
so well as old and young. He too gave up.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Shall we ride?” asked Letitia, as lord F——
looked at his watch. “I can send Thérèse
home with the children.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Suppose we take them ourselves. This may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.24'>24</span>be the last morning for some time that I shall be
able to devote to you and yours.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It may be the last time we shall see Maria
for some weeks,” replied Letitia. “I am glad
you can go.”</p>

<p class='c001'>As soon as they were seated in the carriage,
lady F—— explained that Waldie was so much
out of spirits, and looked so wretchedly ill, that
his wife was bent on getting him from home.
She was sure he must have overworked himself
at business, and he did not attempt to account
for his depression in any other way.</p>

<p class='c001'>“You had better take them down to Weston
with you,” said lord F——. “It will be a comfort
to you to have your sister with you till I can
join you.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“None whatever,” said Letitia, smiling.
“While you are a man of business, I will not
be a woman of pleasure. I will stay in town
till you can introduce Weston and me to each
other.”</p>

<p class='c001'>And Letitia would hear nothing about the heat,
the emptiness of the town, the solitude to which
she would be doomed while her husband was
being initiated into his office. In town she would
stay while her husband remained; and so it was
settled, as this happened not to be one of the
points which his lordship had fixed unalterably
within himself.</p>

<p class='c001'>“There is papa!” exclaimed the eldest child,
quitting her stand at the carriage window, and
clinging to her aunt’s neck, as soon as they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.25'>25</span>entered the sweep which led up to Mr. Waldie’s
door.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes; it is your papa. I wonder what brings
him home so long before dinner to-day.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Waldie had been standing with his hands in
his pockets, gazing on vacancy, till the sound of
the carriage wheels roused him. When he saw
who was come, he appeared suddenly busy among
his shrubs, and turned his back towards the house
door.—Maria appeared, with a smile; but there
was discomposure under it.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Go and tell papa, my dear. He did not see
the carriage. Go and ask him to come in.”</p>

<p class='c001'>But the child for once was slow to obey. She
clung closer to her mamma the more she was bid
to go.</p>

<p class='c001'>“We will go together,” said Letitia, leading
the way to where Waldie was half buried among
the shrubs. When he could no longer pretend
not to see them, he came forward and shook
hands; but his countenance was black as night.
His anxious wife busied herself in pointing out
how grievously the Portugal laurels were
blighted.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Blighted! aye, look! Not a leaf that does
not crumble like ashes in my hand,” said Waldie,
twitching off a spray and crumbling the leaves.
“I had set my heart upon these laurels, and now
to see them ruined in this way.... Damn the
blight!” muttered he between his teeth.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I hear there is much mischief done in Kent,”
observed lord F——.</p>

<p class='c001'>“In Kent! You would think there had been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.26'>26</span>a shower of Gomorrah rain by the look of the
place. Young ash plantations, miles long, with
their shoots crisped and black, worse than my
laurels. Curse the blight!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And the hops....” lord F—— was going
on to inquire; but Mrs. Waldie held up her finger
to stop him. He broke off suddenly, and Waldie
turned round upon his wife with a look which
made her change colour. In order to relieve
everybody, lord F—— summoned up all his experiences
of the mischiefs done by blight at
Weston, diverging gradually upon topics nearly
related,—modes of improving, embellishing, &#38;c.,
and ending with an invitation to the Waldies to
go down and occupy the place for the few weeks
of its greatest beauty. Waldie glanced quickly
from one to another, as if suspicious of some plot
to humour and amuse him, and then bluntly intimated
that his going from home at present was
out of the question. Scarcely another word could
be got out of him, even when the ladies had
walked away into the greenhouse, and the children
had tried who could run fastest from
papa, leaving him alone with lord F——.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Do not you think him looking very ill,—very
much altered?” inquired Maria of her
sister, with a quivering lip.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Very unlike himself to-day, certainly. Something
has discomposed him. But you must not
fancy him more ill than he is. No man varies
more from hour to hour, you know. He may
be quite a different man to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Maria shook her head, and then asked Letitia
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.27'>27</span>to observe what they came to see, without delay.
She should not like her husband to think they
were consulting about his looks. Letitia snatched
up the plant in question, and carried it to lord
F—— to ask whether there were any of the kind
in the Weston greenhouses.</p>

<p class='c001'>“You had better take it with you,” said
Waldie. “It requires a greenhouse, and we
shall have no greenhouses when we remove.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Remove!” said his wife faintly.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Remove! yes, my dear. You would not
stay here, would you? The blights ruin everything
I set my heart upon; and you know I
cannot bear to see a house so exposed as ours,
with not a tree to cast a particle of shade on any
part of it. There is Erpingham’s house, down
below, with those fine spreading sycamores beside
it ... that is something like a house. We
could live there for a lifetime, and never grow
tired of it. But you see it will take a lifetime
for our clumps to grow roof-high. I shall move
into the city.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Nevertheless we shall find you still here, five
years hence,” said lord F——, smiling. “When
the blights are over, you will love this pretty
place too well to leave it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Curse the blights!” was the reply.</p>

<p class='c001'>“You have not been in town to-day, Waldie?”
said lord F——. “Then you have probably
not heard that I have taken office....”</p>

<p class='c001'>“At the Board of Trade?—Well! I suppose
one ought to be glad of it,—I suppose you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.28'>28</span>expect to be congratulated; but, upon my soul,
I do not know how to feel upon it. There is
such a curse clinging to trade. People talk of
the honour and glory of being a British merchant,
and of legislating for British merchants.
I wish both you and I, my lord, may not find
more plague than profit in it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I know I am about to encounter much perplexity,
Waldie—perhaps some abuse, and certainly,
much painful knowledge about the distresses
of the country. Nevertheless, I have
accepted office—or I should rather say, we have
taken office; for Letitia remains in town as long
as business detains me here.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I am glad you allow wives to be official
too,” said Letitia, smiling. “Come plague,
come profit, brother, it is hardly fair that they
should have double the one and only half the other;
which is the case when they are shut out from
that department of their husbands’ concerns.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“‘Double, double toil and trouble’....”
said lord F——.</p>

<p class='c001'>“And watchfulness, and struggle, and woe,”
continued Letitia, “when they feel they could
solace and help, and are not allowed. When
I find I can do neither, I will go down to Weston
without another word.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“My dear,” said Waldie, “would you like to
take the children down to Weston? I must stay
in town, but....”</p>

<p class='c001'>“O, indeed, we want no change. Unless
you ... you....”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2.29'>29</span>“Then we will remain at home this summer,
lord F——, thank you. Our wives both prefer
it, I see.”</p>

<p class='c001'>And Mr. Waldie put some cheerfulness into
his manner as he handed lady F—— into the
carriage. At the first opening in the trees,
Letitia saw him draw his wife’s arm within his
own, and walk with her towards the house.</p>

<p class='c001'>“It cannot be the blight that has soured him
so,” observed lady F—— to her husband. “That
must be a mere pretence.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Blights destroy other things besides Portugal
laurels,” replied her husband. “Did not you
see how I was forbidden to enlarge upon hops?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“What can he have to do with hops? O! I
begin to see. Speculation is to be his ruin,—not
wine, or gaming.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Must he be ruined?” enquired lord F——.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes. There is wide ruin in success, where it
comes from speculation. Ruin of peace.—Who
would possess paradise, if it were on an island
which might be sunk in the sea at any moment?
O! poor Maria!”</p>

<hr class='c015'>

<h3 id='ch2.3' class='c020'><span class='sc'>Chapter III.</span><br> <br> DISCUSSION.</h3>

<p class='c017'>Week after week the steward sent reports from
Weston of the beauty of the place, and the high
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.30'>30</span>order it was kept in for its lady’s approval, and
the impatience of the tenants and the villagers for
my lord and lady’s arrival. Week after week
did friends and acquaintance leave town, till it
became what the inhabitants of Westminster call
a desert, though it would still puzzle a child to
perceive the resemblance between it and the solitary
places where lions await the lonely wayfarer.
Week by week did Mrs. Philips expatiate
on the delights of watering-places, and the
charms of the country, and the intolerableness of
town in the summer,—and still neither master
nor mistress seemed to dream of stirring. “A
few weeks in the autumn! Was that all the
change they were to have? And how were they
to exist till the autumn, she should like to know?”
Lady F—— was so far from wishing that Philips
should not exist, that on learning her discontents,
she took immediate measures for forwarding
her to her dear lady Frances, more than
half of whose pleasure at Brighton had been
spoiled by her having no one to manage her
toilet on whose taste she could rely as a corroboration
of her own. The day which saw Philips
deposited in a Brighton coach brought ease not
only to herself, but to those who lost, and her
who gained her. Philips was certainly right.
Her talents were not appreciated in her new
home; and she would indeed never be able to
make anything of her new lady. Like other
persons of genius, mere kindness was not enough
for Philips; she pined for sympathy, congeniality,
and applause, for which London affords no
scope in the summer season.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2.31'>31</span>How Thérèse sang as she watered her lady’s
plants, that day! How many confessions had
she to pour forth to her old priest of feelings in
which he traced incipient envy and jealousy, but
in which she acknowledged only fear and dislike!
How long a letter did she write to her
father to inform him of her promotion to Mrs.
Philips’s place, and consequent increase of
salary;—of her intention to take a few lessons in
hair-dressing, now that she could afford it, and
felt it to be due to her mistress; and how happy
she should be, when this duty to madame was
provided for, to send money enough to put Annette
to school, and perhaps even to place a new hot-bed
at her father’s disposal!—How charming a
variety was made in the household by a passing
visit from the earl! And how pleased he looked
when, on popping his head in at the library-door,
late one evening, he found Letitia acting as
secretary to her husband, looking over books,
making notes, and preparing materials for a
reply to a deputation which was to wait on him
the next morning.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I hope you like hard work as well as you
thought you should,” said he, laughing. “Have
you begun to think yet of petitioning for a more
equal division of it,—for a multiplication of
places?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Heaven forbid!” exclaimed Letitia. “A
multiplication of places now, when there is such
an outcry against places and placemen! It
would be as much as our lives are worth.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And, what is more to the purpose,” said
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.32'>32</span>lord F——, “it is unnecessary. It matters
little that it is the fashion to mix up in ignorant
minds the odium of holding a sinecure, and the
honour of filling a laborious office;—it matters
little that all the people have not yet learned to
distinguish the caterpillars from the silk-worms
of the state; for they will soon learn to hold the
servants of the nation in due honour. Meanwhile,
all that we want is a more equal distribution
of the toils of government.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“All that we want, son! It is much to want.
What an absurdity it seems that a nobleman
should, from having merely his private affairs to
manage, be suddenly burdened with the responsibilities
of an empire;—a burden, under which
how many have been crushed! Again, there is
your old school-fellow, lord H——, yawning
half the day on the pier at Brighton, and airing
his horses the other half, while you are sitting
here, pen in hand, from morning till night.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I have no objection to it, sir. It has been
a serious grievance to me, ever since I returned
from my travels, that I had nothing better to do
than what I have been doing.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Studying, growing accomplished, falling in
love, and marrying,” replied the earl, laughing.
“What would you have been doing more?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“As it happens, sir, all this proves an excellent
preparation for my present business. But
I did not know that it would; and I was perpetually
asking myself,—moreover, Letitia was perpetually
asking me,—the end and aim of my
employments.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2.33'>33</span>“That was the secret, I dare say,” said the
earl, “of your difficulty in winning her. Eh,
Letitia?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Indeed it was,” replied Letitia, blushing.
“God knows what difficulty I found in making
it a difficulty; but I dared not at once give up
the calling which nature had sanctified to me,
without providing for my race being served in an
equal proportion in some other way. If there be
one note sooner than another to which conscience
awakes in these times, it is to the cry of unserved
humanity; and mine, having been once thus
awakened, could not be lulled asleep again;
and even your son could not soothe it till he
began to promise that we should labour together
for all, as well as for each other.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“So you married to be useful;—for no other
reason on earth, my dear?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“No, no, no. I was useful before. I married
... for the same reason as your son.
But this reason did not make me forget my responsibilities;
that is all.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ah, my dear: you do not know,—highly as
you rate your art,—what you have deprived
society of by shutting yourself up here. Why,—I
saw that sot, colonel Bibber, turned into a
patriot for full three hours under your influence;
and poor little lord H. that we were speaking of
just now, grew almost magnanimous for the same
space of time. These, and hundreds more, owe
to you, my dear, the greater part of whatever
virtue has visited them for the last five years.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2.34'>34</span>“If so,” said lord F——, “what was the
effect on better people?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“The effect that the fine arts are ordained to
produce,” said Letitia. “They have much to
answer for who defame them,—who perceive
nothing in them besides colours, and sounds, and
motion,—who put a kaleidoscope and Raphael’s
Transfiguration on a level, and recognize nothing
more in a symphony of Mozart than in an Eolian
harp, and see no matter of choice between a
merry Andrew and Kean in Hamlet. They who
perceive not that the fine arts are the fittest embodiments
of truth and beauty are unconscious
of the vastness of the department in which they
would have man remain unserved. Such would
wonder or laugh at my view of my profession,
and discredit my hesitating to leave it for lord
F——.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You were satisfied that you held a commission
to serve man, by means of the fine arts;
you were right, my dear, as is proved by your
having made the colonel a patriot, and the little
lord a hero.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“That it was only for three hours at a time,”
said Letitia, “was not my fault, but that of the
arrangements by which means and ends are
sometimes separated as far asunder as if the
world would be perilled by their coming together.
In this, we might wisely copy from
man in his state of nature. Indian savages
have their songs and dances immediately before
their battles; and, as long as prayers imply devotion,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.35'>35</span>they are everywhere used in senates as a
prelude to the business of the nation. But we
go straight from an oratorio to dinner, from
a tragedy to sleep, from the Elgin marbles to
shopping in Regent-street; while, on the other
hand, if a great national question has to be debated,
a mighty national achievement to be
wrought, the last thing its conductors would
think of would be to spiritualise the passions, and
elevate the emotions, and animate the faculties
by the most appropriate means which Providence
has given for that end.—I know that this
union can be only partially effected yet. I
know that the passage of the Reform Bill would
have been but little helped by any such appliances
as we can at present exhibit; but it will
be different hereafter, when men have learned
the true office of the fine arts, and the ultimate
objects of political reforms. Then, hundreds of
years hence, it may be,—if a new question of
national renovation should be brought forward,
the senate to whom it is committed may lay
hold, with one accord, on whatever prior observance
may best soothe down their animosities,
and banish their petty self-regards, and establish
their minds in that state of lofty tranquillity which
alone beseems the master-spirits of an empire.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“In those days,” said lord F——, “there
will be an end of the absurdity of admitting the
ennobling influence of the fine arts, and at the
same time holding its professors in contempt.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Is it, even now, anything more than a
nominal contempt?” asked Letitia. “Do not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.36'>36</span>people mix up the profession and the vices of its
professors together, and then talk of contempt?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But those very vices are caused by the
treatment of the profession.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“True; like all other professional vices,—like
all the peculiar failings of certain classes,—like
the avarice of Jews, the romancing of travellers,
the spiritual pride of sectaries, the vanity
of authors. When prejudices are so far surmounted
as that no class shall be regarded with
factitious deference or contempt, there will be
an end of all occasion to reproach painters, musicians
and actors with their tendency to self-indulgence,
at the same time that proverbs and
by-words against Jews, methodists, travellers,
and poets, will fall into oblivion.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“In those days,” said lord F——, “perhaps
our peerage may honour itself by taking
up the profession of the fine arts. The time is
coming when no class of society may be idle;
and if the aristocracy plumes itself upon its refinement,
this seems to be the pursuit most congenial
to its constitution.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“If you preach your doctrine,—that all must
work,—to those of your own condition,” said
the earl, “they will ask you where you got the
notion,—whether you are intimidated by the
clamours of the lower classes.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Not intimidated by their clamours, but
moved by their condition, I would tell them,
sir; and that I derive my notion from the
nature of man and of society, and not from the
dictation of any class whatever. It is enough to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.37'>37</span>melt a heart of stone to read and hear of such
distresses as have come to my knowledge since
I entered office; but I am convinced that many
of the sufferers look in the wrong direction for
the causes.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yet there must be much cause for complaint,”
said Letitia, “when our institutions
lead to such an opposition of interests as there
now is between different ranks. They should
surely work together....”</p>

<p class='c001'>“The present opposition of interests, my dear,
arises from a scarcity of the prime necessaries of
life. If there were food enough for our people,
their occupations and interests, be they as various
as the minds that adopt them, would assist
and promote each other from end to end of society.
If there be a scarcity of food, men will
snatch from one another’s mouths, be they huddled
together in our manufacturing cities, or
duly distributed in a Moravian settlement. Where
there is plenty, there will be a harmony,—where
there is want, there will be an opposition of interests;
and it is folly to assign co-operation
and competition as the remedy and cause of
distress.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Nay; but can it be right that starving
thousands should bid their labour against one
another for bread? Can it be right that whole
families should, at this moment, be crouching
down supperless in their litter of straw, while
we.... O, I am ashamed of our luxuries!...
our mirrors, and harps, and lamps,—and my
very dress. I am ashamed of them all.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2.38'>38</span>“If we gave them all away this moment, my
dear, they would not be food; and if exchanged
for bread, they would only take food from the
mouths of some who want it, to give to those
who cannot want it more. Believe me, the inequality
of condition we are complaining of is
rather checked than promoted by competition.
Competition equalizes the profits of industry,
and increases instead of lessening its productiveness.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Whence, then, comes all this misery? all
this tremendous inequality?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“The misery arises from a deficiency of
<a id='corr38.13'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='ood'>food</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_38.13'><ins class='correction'>food</ins></a></span>....”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well; whence this deficiency of food?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“From the tendency of eaters to increase
faster than the supply of food.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But if we can raise more food by co-operation
than without it....”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Even supposing we could,—unless co-operation
also checked the increase of numbers, it
could prove no more than a temporary alleviation
of our grievances. In my opinion, it would, if it
included equality of condition, leave us in a worse
state than it found us, in as far as it would relax
the springs of enterprise and industry, and, in
time, bring the community down into a deplorable
state of sameness; it would, if persevered
in, make us into a nation of half-naked
potatoe eaters, and water-drinkers.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The earl inquired whether anything had been
heard lately of the co-operative society formed in
the neighbourhood of Weston.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2.39'>39</span>“O yes!” replied lord F——. “They are
enjoying the benefits of competition to the
utmost. They ascribe their prosperity to their co-operation;
but they are, in fact, a large partnership
in competition with smaller ones. They do not
see how their relative position would be altered
by their absorbing all their competitors into their
firm, with no check to their numbers, while
nature has imposed perpetual checks upon the
growth of their capital.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But cannot numbers be checked,—cannot
the checks upon the growth of capital be evaded,
while we have such a wide world to move about
in?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Certainly, my dear: but there is no need of
equality of condition to help us to do this. Competition
is more likely than co-operation to induce
prudence and foresight; and it will quicken our
activity in carrying our surplus numbers to distant
fertile lands, or in bringing the produce of
distant fertile lands among our own people,
instead of tempting us to waste more and more
of our capital continually in turning up inferior
lands at home, as the co-operatives would have
us do.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But were not you telling me that your rent-roll
becomes more valuable as time passes? Are
not landholders’ incomes increasing perpetually
under the present system?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“They are; but this is the consequence, not
of competition, but of the varying qualities of the
land, the tillage of every new grade of which
tends to lower profits and raise rents. No plan
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.40'>40</span>for the distribution of home produce can affect
the law by which the returns to capital are perpetually
diminished.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But what will be the end of it under the
present system?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“There are two extremes to which the systems
of equality and inequality of distribution respectively
tend, in as far as they involve restriction
upon food by using only the produce of our own
lands. Under the equality system, there would
be an ultimate scramble for potatoes, or a worse
diet still, if there were such a thing. Under our
present system, the whole produce must in time
be in the hands of the land-owners and tax-takers.
Of course, we must change our system; not,
however, by discouraging competition, or abolishing
private property, but by removing all
artificial restrictions upon food, and by regulating
our numbers according to our resources. The
way to bring down landlords’ rents, and to increase
the profits of cultivators, is to procure food
from some better source than our own inferior
lands; and this I will prove to you by figures,
the next time my steward brings me the accounts
of my farms.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“O, that Moravian village!” exclaimed Letitia.
“How often I think of the day we spent
there! There was comfort, there was abundance,
there was mutual assistance and agreement.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Are you quite sure, Letitia, that there was
nothing in the situation and peculiarities of the
place which called off your attention from the
principle on which the society was constituted?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.41'>41</span>Remember the sunset, that evening; the golden
light on the green hill side, above the rows of
Moravian dwellings. Remember your admiration
of the internal regulations,—of the women’s
uniform, of the music in their church, of the simplicity
of their way of life. Remember that all
this has nothing to do with their principle of
association.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You must no more set the accomplishments
of the Moravians to the account of community
of goods, than the absurdities of the Shakers,”
observed the earl. “That some sing beautifully,
and others dance ridiculously, has nothing to do
with the distribution of their wealth.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“No more than the ordinances of the Harmonites,”
continued lord F——. “Mr. Owen’s
followers very properly refuse to be mixed up with
Moravians, Shakers, and Harmonites. Superstition
has no part in their system, either under
the form of ritual observance or celibacy. Yet
they are apt to incorporate extraneous matters
with their system, which serve as allurements to
a greater extent, I doubt not, than they intend.
They owe more converts than they suppose to
their promises of mansions, pleasure-grounds,
coffee, alabaster lamps, and so on. My wonder
is that more are not enticed by descriptions like
these, accompanied with promises of ease, and
leisure, and many other things to be obtained
in a short time, which the poor man now
sees little chance of his children’s children ever
enjoying.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“There might be alabaster lamps and damask
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.42'>42</span>furniture in every house under the present system,”
observed the earl, “if food enough could
be got to keep the production of capital going at
its natural rate; aye, and ease and leisure too, if
our numbers were kept within bounds. It is
not so very long since shoes and stockings were
worn only in courts; and that they are now worn
by peasants proves that our capital has grown
under a system of competition. That multitudes
have little ease and no leisure is the fault of over-population,
which would be rather aggravated
than lessened under a system whose very essence
it is to cast each man’s burdens upon all. No
man need scruple to have twenty of his children
gracing the dinner-table of a co-operative establishment,
till he should find, too late, that not all
the savings caused by extensive association can
compensate for the falling off in the produce of
inferior lands, and for the new impulse given to
population. His sons and his sons’ sons must
add more and more labour to the common stock;
must give up, first, damask and alabaster, then
broadcloth and glass; then descend to sackcloth
and wooden trenchers, then to tatters, potatoes
and water, and then....”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Then would ensue a scramble; if anything
should be left, competition would come into play
again; society would rise by its means, and might
possibly attain once more to a state in which they
might speculate on the universality of damask
and alabaster.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well!” exclaimed Letitia, “I shall ask to
look at your steward’s accounts, and to have an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.43'>43</span>explanation of them; for I do not at all like our
present position. We must reach the extreme,
you say, of having our whole produce in the
hands of land-owners and tax-takers, unless we
change our system.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes, my dear: but by change of system, I
do not mean convulsion. All might be set on
a safe footing by timely care, the removal of
restrictions, the diffusion of intelligence. There
is nothing in all this, threatening to public dignity
or private safety. There is nothing to lessen
the security of property, or to endanger the
rights of any class; but quite the contrary: for
property is never so secure as when it most
abounds; and rights are never so well respected
as in the absence of temptation to infringe upon
them.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“By change, then, you mean progression,
without fear of subversion.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Just so; the progression of society from an
advanced into a higher state. What is there in
such progression that is not as beautiful in theory
as it is found to be necessary in practice?”</p>

<p class='c001'>From this hour, the progression of society, of
which Letitia had long dreamed, on which she
had often speculated, began to assume distinctness
in her mind, and to form a large part of her conversation
when she happened to be with those to
whom she could speak most of what was most in
her thoughts. Whenever she heard of misery and
crime on a large scale, she satisfied herself that
the national demand of progression had not yet
been sufficiently attended to. When she heard
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.44'>44</span>that her lord’s rents ought to be more, but were,
from the difficulty of collecting them, less than
formerly, she sighed for the time when an unrestricted
provision of food (unrestricted by
state-laws) should check the rise of rents. Whenever
she sat down by her husband’s side to hear
curious tales of the doings of large speculators
or eminent merchants, or of the sufferings of
large classes of agricultural or manufacturing
labourers, she learned something that made her
wonder and lament, that, while the natural laws of
production and distribution work out evenly their
balance of results, the tendency of legislation
thus far seems to be to clog and thwart them,
and delay the progression in intelligence and
comfort which must arise out of their unobstructed
operation. She saw that, if the universal interest
of society was allowed to be the moving spring
of the social economy, all would be served; and
that if many yet remain unserved, it is on
account of other movements being made to interfere
with it—the petty springs of narrow and
mistaken interests; so that partial protection
brings on general hardship, and arbitrary stimulus,
a condition of general suffering.</p>

<p class='c001'>Before going down to Weston, Letitia had
become prepared to make her way with the
steward, the co-operating workmen in the village,
and all who could throw light on the past and
present state of property in the place. Many a
conversation and calculation had she also gone
through with Thérèse on the subject of shop-keeping
in Paris; and all that Maria told of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.45'>45</span>Waldie’s business went to the same account of
information. It made poor Maria smile sometimes
in the midst of a fit of anxiety to find that
her children’s babble savoured of political economy,
when they had been spending a morning
with their aunt. They were more ready then than
at other times to wonder why they had dolls in
the nursery, and picture-books in the parlour, and
a shell-grotto in the garden, when many other
little children had no playthings; and why poor
Ned who swept the crossing was so much more
ragged than their errand boy, when Ned worked
the hardest of the two, and was often out in the
cold and the rain besides. Almost babies as
they were, they could sometimes find out very
sage little reasons for these things, when put on
the right scent by aunt Letitia or her pupil
Thérèse.</p>

<hr class='c015'>

<h3 id='ch2.4' class='c020'><span class='sc'>Chapter IV.</span><br> <br> MORE NOVELTY.</h3>

<p class='c017'>At length came September, with its utter dulness
in town, and its busy brightness in the country.
No parliament, no ministry, no court, with whose
proceedings to diversify the daily papers; but
instead, a reporting of the progress of certain
noble lords and patriotic gentlemen from one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.46'>46</span>country seat to another, with accurate calculations
of the quantity of game bagged by each. Now
were expresses hurrying to and fro in search of
the runaway men in power. Now were ancient
ladies proudly leaning on the arms of sons, who
were happy in being allowed breathing time to
watch the autumn sunsets from the terraces of
their stately castles. Now were the young heirs
of rank and wealth initiated by playful papas
into the mysteries of riding and sham shooting.
Many a little lord was now mounted on his pony
to adventure forth as far as the park gates, while
mamma and sisters waved their handkerchiefs from
afar, and careful grooms waited to lead him back
safe. Many such a little rogue carried his mimic
fowling-piece into the stubble, and learned not
to wink or flinch when papa brought down a
bird, or coaxed the gamekeeper to lend him a
brace or two to carry when they should come in
sight of home and the girls. Many a tenant now
put himself in the way of a greeting from his
landlord, resting on a stile, or pacing his way
slowly through a field. Many a state secret,
that the public would fain have known, was dismissed
for some such freak as snatching at a
high hazel twig, or leaping a gate. Many a fair
family group of riders was seen threading green
lanes, or cantering over downs, or appearing and
disappearing in the clumpy drives of a park,—graceful
boys, and high-born girls, leading their
father in search of some new beauty which it
turns out he discovered in like manner, when he
was a pleasure-loving youth instead of a statesman.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.47'>47</span>Now, in the golden noon, was the boat
seen to unfurl its snowy sail, and glide in rivalship
of grace with the swans which diverged
on either hand to let the vessel have its way
without disturbing their serenity. He who has
guided, or may guide, the helm of the state, now
condescends to steer a less majestic bark on a
calmer element; and instead of the prayers,
threats and blessings of an empire, bends his ear
to the prattle of his little ones, or to the rustling
of a startled deer, bounding from the thicket as
the vessel nears the shore. Not now too busy
to observe whether rain or sunshine be without,
the recreated statesman finds in either case equal
pleasure and repose. His lady’s nursery and
boudoir, his sons’ classics, his daughters’ music,
his library, his billiard table, and withal some
peculiar and long relinquished pet pursuit, give
him as much pleasure on a rainy day, as the
flower-garden, the fish-pond and poultry-yard
when the sky is blue overhead. He sighs over
his past toils, reminds his spouse of their wedding
sojourn at Chamouni, and at intervals quotes
Virgil to the lad behind his chair, and whispers
Pope to the little lady netting at his elbow.
Statesmanship should have pleasures worthy of
its toils; and so thought Letitia when her husband
first mutely pointed out to her the woods of
Weston.</p>

<p class='c001'>Sweet was the leisure of the first afternoon,
which gave promise of what should be done at
future intervals of leisure;—intervals not likely
to be too frequent to retain their charm. His
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.48'>48</span>lordship had brought his business and its apparatus
with him; but for this day all was laid
aside. Within half an hour after alighting from
the carriage, and while dinner was being served
up, my lord and lady were in the rosery,
observing on what must have been its beauty a
few weeks before, and the one pointing out and
the other following with eager eyes the tracts
among the hanging woods which had to be explored,
the points of view which must be visited,
one at sunrise, one in the glowing noon, another
in the still evening. As soon as dinner was over,
they were out again, that Letitia might see the
ruins of the old abbey before the sunlight should
have departed. Her heart melted within her
when she saw the long shadows of the lofty arch
extended on the velvet turf, motionless except
when a bird took wing from among the ivy, and
set its boughs dancing. The rooks sailed in
circles above the stately ruin, and the thrush
piped from the evergreen covert which shut in
the retired nook in which it stood. The sun-dial
also marked the silent lapse of time, although
there was usually none to lay the lesson to heart.</p>

<p class='c001'>“This is the place, love,” said lord F——.</p>

<p class='c001'>“And you would have had me come without
you,” said Letitia, after a long pause.</p>

<p class='c001'>“We have some weeks yet, to be sure, to
enjoy it. This is the last spot that looks desolate
as winter comes on. No leafless trees, no
strewn blossoms! The wall-flowers there on
the pinnacle flourish late; and all is green and
bright till the snow falls.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2.49'>49</span>“And after, surely,” said Letitia. “I should
like to see icicles glistening on these arches,
springing grey from the sheeted snow. I should
like to see the ivy sprays bending under their
white burden, or shaking it off in a shower of
sparkles at the breeze’s bidding. O let us come
here at Christmas!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“If we do, you may chance to see another
sight. You will see tracks of small feet in the
snow, and catch some little girl, in her red cloak,
stealing from the Wishing-Well.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“The Wishing-Well! O where?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It springs from under an old stump behind
this wall. Have you any wishes?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I will make some for the superstition’s
sake.”</p>

<p class='c001'>And immediately Letitia might be seen unbonneted,
kneeling on the consecrated stone, and
drinking the draught her husband had filled for
her. Thus was she seen, as presently appeared.
A voice reached them from one side, praying that
her ladyship’s wishes might come to pass, be
they what they might, as they must be for good and
no harm to the people under her. Letitia sprang
up, laughing, and her husband replaced her hat,
calling to the well-wisher to show himself. He
did so, not in the shape of a hardy labourer, with
his farming or gardening tools on his shoulder;
nor yet of a picturesque old man bending beneath
his faggot. Such might better have beseemed
the place: but this was a middle-aged, shrewd-looking
little man, whom one would have guessed
to be town-bred. He came forward, saying that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.50'>50</span>he had a message for her ladyship from his wife;—my
lord knew his wife.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Not I,” said his lordship. “I did not know
you had a wife.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“May be not, my lord; but you know the
woman. She that keeps the grocery shop, as
you turn the corner in the village, your lordship
remembers.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“What! Nanny Sweet? So you have taken
her to wife since I saw you last.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes, my lord. She has a very good business,
or had before the equality folks set up a
store against us. I don’t like equality, not I.
But my wife sends word, my lady....”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You do not like equality!” interrupted Letitia.
“If there was equality, you know, you would
not need to mind who set up a store, and what
came of your wife’s grocery business.—And do
not you like this place too,—these woods, and
the deer, and the lake?”</p>

<p class='c001'>White lauded the grandeur and beauty of
Weston.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well; this place would be as much yours
as ours if there was equality. You might fish on
the lake, and shoot in the preserves, and....”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And lie down to sleep in the sun here beside
the well,” continued lord F——; “and all
without asking anybody’s leave.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I thank you kindly, my lord; but I like
sleeping in my bed, if I sleep at all, unless it be
dozing over my pipe, while Jack is reading the
news at the Duke’s Head. The only time I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.51'>51</span>went fishing, I fell into the water; so you’ll not
soon find me in a boat again. My wife and I
like a chicken now and then, on Sundays; so a
share of your poultry-yard would be welcome
perhaps; and, as for the deer and game, I leave
it to other folks to get out of their warm beds
for the sake of it. It would not answer to me to
be laid by with the rheumatism for such a cause,
you see.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But there would be no poaching if there
was equality,” said Letitia, laughing. “Cannot
game be shot in the daytime?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“By none but gentlemen, my lady, as I have
always heard. However, the equality folks have
no more game, as far as I know, than other
people. The most they pretend to is to have
plenty of butcher’s meat.—What I pretend to,
and Nanny too, is to get our bread honestly;
and so, my lady, she bade me tell you that she
has laid in a new stock, hearing your ladyship
was coming, and has lost already by its being
September instead of June. Light ginghams for
morning wear....”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I thought your wife was a grocer.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Grocer and draper, my lady. If your ladyship
should find the mornings chilly, as they will
be soon, perhaps you would look at her stuffs;—a
very pretty variety of browns, as you will see,
my lady. And her tea and sugar is of the best;
and as for her snuffs....”</p>

<p class='c001'>“O, I must make acquaintance with her
snuffs, of course. Have you a pinch about
you?”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2.52'>52</span>“And what is your occupation now, White?”
inquired lord F——.</p>

<p class='c001'>“The last thing I had to do, my lord, was
lining your lordship’s pew at church, and covering
the hassocks.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And what did your priest say to that?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Lord, sir, I cleared scores with the priest
long ago; ever since I was employed to white-wash
the Baptist chapel.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Were you once a Catholic?” inquired
Letitia.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes, my lady. There was carving work to
do at Sir William’s chapel, and I got a good
long job.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And were a Catholic while it lasted, and a
Baptist after white-washing the meeting-house?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“To be sure, my lady; I took a part in the
week-day meetings after that.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Till you were employed to line my pew;
and now, I dare say, you are a very good
churchman?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I hope to be so, my lord. Your lordship
may laugh, but I know what manners is. I
wouldn’t be so unhandsome as to take work at
one place, and attend at another.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“So your interest has nothing at all to do
with it, White; only manners. But I wonder now
what you think your religion is worth, if you can
change and change again as you have done?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Why, my lord, I think religion is a very
good thing, as long as it does not come in one’s
way: but one must make sacrifices to duty, as
all the clergy tell us; and is it not my duty to
get my living the best way I can?”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2.53'>53</span>“Well, White; tell your wife I will step
down to see her stock, some day soon. I do not
at present take snuff; but whenever I do, I will
be her customer.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Thérèse and her mistress kept one another
waiting this night. The housekeeper, who was
much amused with Thérèse’s broken English
and unbroken simplicity, invited her out to a
turn in the shrubberies when tea was sent in,
and she was sure of not being wanted for an hour
or two. When they came in again, they found
that their master and mistress had once more
wandered forth, tempted by the rising of the
clear full moon behind the woods. After sitting
nearly an hour in the dressing-room, Thérèse
put faith in the housekeeper’s prophecy that her
master would stay abroad till after midnight, like
a child as he always was, or one that lived on
air, the first few days after his coming down
from town. Thérèse looked out and longed for
another ramble. The dressing-room lamp shed
a pearly light through the room; but a golden
planet hung over the opposite beechen grove: a
small bright fire burned in the grate; but it was
less cheering than the bracing evening air: the
time-piece ticked drowsily amidst the silence;
but it was less soothing than the coming and
going of the night-breeze among the elms
in the green walk. Thérèse could not resist.
Once more she ran out, promising herself that
she would be back in ten minutes,—long before
her mistress should be ready for her. In an
hour, startled by the striking of the village clock,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.54'>54</span>she returned, and found Letitia, half undressed,
still gazing from the window.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ah, madam!” cried Thérèse, terrified; “I
am very, very wrong....”</p>

<p class='c001'>As she hastened, with trembling hands, to
throw off her cloak, and arrange the toilet-table,
appealing the while to the moon and other temptations,
Letitia, under a sudden impulse, ran and
kissed the astonished Thérèse, crying, “O Thérèse,
how happy we shall be here!” Thérèse
returned the kiss again and again before she
stopped to consider what she was about. As soon
as Letitia could repress her inclination to laugh,
she observed that they seemed all to have set
aside common rules to-day, and to have their
heads turned alike by coming into the country.
After this, Thérèse would be in waiting at the
proper hour, and she herself....</p>

<p class='c001'>“And you, madam ...” said Thérèse, half-smiling.
“You will not make me forget that
there is one in this country who loves me as
some love me at home; but this will redouble
my respect, madam.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I hope it will, Thérèse; for I need to be reminded
now and then.... I was not always
lady F——, you know; and a moon-light night
makes me forget these things sometimes. We
are all equal in reality, except when ignorance,
and all that comes of ignorance, separates us
from one another; so there may be friendship,—there
is friendship between you and me, Thérèse.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“The knowledge which you have given me,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.55'>55</span>madam, will make this friendship my secret treasure.
No one will know it who cannot also be
your friend.—But many ladies put confidence in
their maids, and tell them such things as I have
never heard from you. Mrs. Philips....”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Mrs. Philips, I suspect, Thérèse, had much
more to tell than she ever was told; at least, her
secrets were of a kind that will never be known
to come from me. Your confessor shall never
have to warn you against me,—unless, indeed, it
be my heresy. I would not spoil you, my dear;
and that is the reason why I keep you so much
with me. It would be hard if I did not love you
and let you love me. Now go to bed; and
when the sun shines, instead of the moon, we
must forget all the wild things we have done this
first day.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I shall never be fit to be a countess,” was her
confession to lord F——; “I kissed my maid
last night.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“What, Philips!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“O no, no. That would be idiotcy. Philips
is at Brighton, you know, where lady Frances
spoils her by a more pernicious familiarity than
mine with Thérèse. But really this girl wins
one’s heart as if she had been born one’s younger
sister.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I dare say she is some countess, or countess’s
daughter in disguise; or so some romantic ladies
might fancy.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ladies who think that nobility is only hereditary.
There is disguised nobility in Thérèse;
but her patent is sealed with an impress which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.56'>56</span>there are few to recognize, and it is deposited
where not many trouble themselves to look
for it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Side by side with yours, love. Happily,
your nobility of that better kind needs be disguised
no more than the lesser which you have
acquired. This was the chief satisfaction I had
in giving you the lesser.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“We will look among the equality folks, as
White calls them, for specimens of natural nobility.
According to their theory, such always
assumes its rank among them, does it not?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“This is one of the professed objects of their
system; but it is not fair to look for its fulfilment
in such small societies as they have yet
been able to form. Master minds are thinly
sown.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“There needs not equality of outward condition,”
observed Letitia, “to make the best
minds master minds. Those who, by virtue of a
patent of mental nobility, have held sway over
the national mind, have been of all ranks.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And will so continue to be; for, as long as
men are unlike one another, there will be a distinction
of ranks, though the distinction may be
maintained by a better principle than heritage.
Rank and wealth will, I trust, be in time distributed
according to natural laws; but degrees of
rank and wealth there will always be; and the
advocates of a system of equality would greatly
promote their cause by a frank recognition of this
truth. While all evidence from which a judgment
can be formed is before them, and they come
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.57'>57</span>to a conclusion in direct opposition to the evidence,
I cannot, however much I may respect
them on some accounts, think them wise and safe
guides of the people. The necessity of inequality
of condition may be established thus.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But first tell me whether their favourite
principle of co-operation necessarily involves
equality of condition.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“They would tell you ‘yes.’ I say ‘no.’
They hold that competition is both the cause and
effect of inequality of condition; whereas certain
advocates of co-operation in another country
hold, (and I think wisely,) that their principle
stands a better chance where a gradation of rank
and property is allowed. I so far agree with
these last as to believe the time to be discernible
when co-operation, in a certain sense, shall
prevail,—meaning thereby, when all interests
shall be harmonized instead of opposed; but that
this includes equality of condition, I cannot allow,
since varieties of character seem to me to forbid
such equality.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“There must be an inequality of physical and
mental powers, at all events.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Surely; and therefore an inequality in the
produce of individual labour. No one labours,
or ever will labour, without a view to the fruits;
and those fruits, however appropriated, are property.
If a giant produces ten times as much as
a dwarf, and each is allowed the same middle
portion of the fruits, for his maintenance and
enjoyment, is it to be supposed that the giant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.58'>58</span>will trouble himself henceforth to produce more
than the dwarf?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“He will be more likely to seize some of the
dwarf’s portion.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Certainly; and hence it is clear that the only
security of society lies in awarding to all their
rights, and enforcing upon all their duties; and
what are <em>rights</em> but a man’s exclusive power over
his own produce? What are his <em>duties</em> but
allowing to others the possession of their produce?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You do not think then that the giant and
the dwarf would be alike contented with having
everything they could want or wish for administered
to them in return for a certain portion of
their labour. You do not look forward to the
lion dandling the kid.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I should be afraid the lion would be dandling
the kid when he ought to be out in quest of food.
If there was no inducement to giants to produce
more than dwarfs, there would soon be little to
administer to anybody. The consumption of
giants would soon have to be provided for by the
labour of a community of dwarfs.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“The giants would foresee this, and then....”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Instead of working harder for no recompense,
they would withdraw,—the mightiest first, and
then the next strongest, and so on, till the
weakest of the dwarfs would be left to shift for
themselves as they best might.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And then would come the days of potatoes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.59'>59</span>and wooden trenchers, of which you were speaking
one day.—But this is supposing men to have
the same passions and desires that they have now;
whereas they are to be educated into a better state.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“With all my heart: but the utmost that education
can do is to extend man’s views, to exalt
his aims, to strengthen and vivify his powers,—not
to change his nature. His nature involves
inequality of powers; and this decree of Providence
can never be set aside, or its operation
neutralized by any decree of man that the fruits
of those powers shall be equally divided.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Certainly not; for such a decree of man
involves injustice. If the giant feels it to be unjust
that he must give to others the fruits of
his labour, the dwarf may also complain that he
enjoys no more than the giant, though he works
ten times as hard.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“The dwarf’s complaint would thus be against
Providence, and the giant’s against man; but
both show that equality is an arbitrary state, good
neither for each nor for all. Nothing but compulsion
would retain the giant in it long; and
thus it is clear that, where there is liberty, there
cannot be equality.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“What becomes of the old cry of Liberty and
Equality?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It relates, I imagine, to an equality of rights.
It means an open field and fair play to every
one. This kind of equality I am doing all I can
in my office to procure, by doing away with the
protection to some which imposes burdens upon
others. By the same principle I am bound to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.60'>60</span>oppose that arbitrary equality which enriches the
weak with the fruits of the strongman’s labours.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But there is no force used. All who bind
themselves to equality do it voluntarily.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Certainly. The only applicable force is
force of argument, and the opposition I bring is
an opposition of reasons. If these should not
prevail, a little experience will soon finish the
business. I am only sorry that any should be
dazzled with a delusive prospect of ease and
luxury, when their efforts should be guided in
another direction for the relief of their grievous
burdens. At a time when every one should be
bent on regulating the labour market, providing
for the utmost permanent growth of capital, and
lessening the burdens of taxation, we cannot
spare any from these grand objects to be urging
on the increase of capital at the expense of a
much greater increase of population, and amusing
themselves with visions of what can never be
achieved by the means they propose. Man must
and will be better served as the world grows
older; but it will be by giving the eternal laws
of society fair play, and not by attempting to
subvert them. I shall be surprised if you hear
anything from our neighbours in the village
which will not bear the construction I have put
upon the system as laid down by its originators.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Suppose I make myself popular among them
at once by telling them my tale of last night.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“There is no need, my dear. I trust they do
us the justice to believe that our affections graduate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.61'>61</span>according to a truer scale than that of hereditary
rank.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You have shown that they do by marrying
me.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“All people show it in the most important
circumstances of their lives,—in their attachments.
Alas for man, if the movements within
must correspond with the outward state! Whom
then would kings love?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And (what is more important) how should
the poverty-stricken look up through the ranks
above him, and say, with hope in his eye and
assurance in his voice, ‘I am a brother?’ How
else should the stirring thought be kept alive in
him that his rights will not be for ever overlaid,
his claims not be for ever incompatible with those
of his brethren? Natural affinities are ever
acting, even now, in opposition to circumstance.
They will in time direct us to the due control of
circumstance. Meanwhile, let no class imagine
that any other class denies the existence of these
affinities, or resists their workings.—I will go
and see how they are acting in the village.—Shall
I bring you some of Mrs. White’s snuff?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Why, thank you, I am not aware of any affinity
between a rappee canister and my nostrils.
But the old sexton is a snuff-taker. Call upon
him by all means, and show him that you understand
his likings. He will gratify some of
yours, if you find him in a talkative mood.”</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_2.62'>62</span>
  <h3 id='ch2.5' class='c020'><span class='sc'>Chapter V.</span><br> <br> OBSERVING AT HAND.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c017'>A tribe of little children had gathered round
Mrs. White’s windows before Letitia and Thérèse
arrived at the shop; the reason of which was
that the grocery and drapery goods were disposed
in a new style of elegance, in honour of her ladyship.
Such tempting candies in the one window;
such shining pins, such a rainbow box of
cottons, such rolls of ribands, stuffs, calicoes, and
flannels in the other! The little things could
not be persuaded to move off even when White,
who was on the watch, bustled about to make a
clear path for the lady. There was plenty of
bobbing from the girls, and pulling of forelocks
from the boys; plenty of elbowing, and pushing,
and signing, when it became necessary for
somebody to speak in answer to her kind questions;
but there was no inclination to make way.
They were even rude enough to crowd about the
door and peep in, while she was buying snuff
and sugar-candy.</p>

<p class='c001'>Letitia soon found that if White was shrewd in
changing his occupation and profession according
to circumstances, his wife was no less shrewd in
understanding and conducting her own. It would
be a wonder, the lady thought, if between them,
they did not prove a match for their co-operative
neighbours.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2.63'>63</span>“I charge you the lowest, ma’am, the lowest,
I assure you; and as low as is fair....”</p>

<p class='c001'>“O, I have no doubt of it, Mrs. White. I
am not going to dispute your prices, I assure
you.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Indeed, my lady, I don’t go by the rules of
the folks over the way; and why? Because
they talk of charging only the interest of what
their stock costs them; while I must have profit
too, and that is interest twice over.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“The other half is what you live on, Mrs.
White, instead of consuming part of their stock,
you know.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“True, madam. Double interest is fair profit,
as my father used to say; and he, being a schoolmaster,
knew the right of such things.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And taught them to you, it seems. But
you do not mean to say that all profit is double
interest. There is your neighbour, the apothecary,
he charges at a much higher rate for his
medicines.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Aye,” said White. “His is a fine conjuring
trade. He shakes up three or four things
in a bottle, and what was worth twopence is directly
charged two shillings.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But consider, John, this is not all profit.
Think what he paid for his learning, and what
time he gives up to his patients. He has to pay
himself for all this out of his drugs.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Then why not call some of his gains wages
at once, and charge his patients for such, instead
of pretending to give his time and labour, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.64'>64</span>charging his medicines ten times dearer than he
need?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Many wish to be allowed to do this, I understand,”
said Letitia. “They dislike the temptation
to cram their patients with medicine, in order
to repay the expenses of their education; and
they wish it to be understood, that when we pay
for a blister or a powder, we pay for medical skill
and aid, as well as for Spanish flies or bark. In
the same way, nobody supposes that great physicians
charge guineas for writing five lines of a
prescription, or lawyers for reading over a sheet
of parchment.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“There is the risk in their case,” observed
White, “as well as the education. For one
that gets rich in their profession, there are many
that make but little; and this uncertainty
ought to have a large reward.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“If it was not for such uncertainty, my lady,
I could sell some of my goods cheaper. But in
a place like this, I can never make sure of selling
a new article, as I could in a large town;
so, when I venture upon any thing new, I must
charge it high to make up for my money being
locked up, perhaps, and for the damage of the
goods from lying by.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Like a hackney coachman in a town,” observed
Letitia. “Coach fares are complained
of, as if a driver had to charge only for driving
from one point to another; but besides the interest
of the money his coach and horses cost
him, and the expense of repairs, he must charge
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.65'>65</span>the wages of the many hours and days that he
and his horses are idle on the stand.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well now, ma’am, there is one set of people
whose gains make me more angry than almost
any thing I can mention; and they are the public
players and singers, and such like folks.”</p>

<p class='c001'>White here came round the counter to his
wife’s side, and kicked, and winked, and coughed,
till Nanny and Thérèse were amazed, and Letitia
laughed. Nanny went on,</p>

<p class='c001'>“Lord, John, I know more about that sort of
people than you think, from there being a company
playing in Mr. Jarvis’s barn; and I assure
you, ma’am, the satins they pretended to wear were
all glazed calico; and the jewels, my lady, were
all made of tinfoil. Well; they got, even in a
poor place like this, ever so much more than
their living could have cost them; and I have
heard of some of the better sort,—London actresses
and such,—making more in a night than
an apothecary in a whole year. Why now,
John, what should you know about it, to object
in this way? I tell you....”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I can tell you that it is true,” said Letitia;
“and I can tell you the reason. Besides the
uncertainty, which is much greater in those professions
than in any other, there is a kind of discredit
belonging to them; so that it requires a
very strong inducement to tempt people of great
talent to engage in them. When the time
comes,—and I expect it will come,—for public
singers and actors to be treated with proper respect,
the best of them will not be paid extravagantly,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.66'>66</span>and the inferior ones will not be half-starved,
as they are now. There will be no
disgrace, and less uncertainty; and payment
will therefore be more equal.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Then perhaps scavengers will be paid no
more than plough-boys; for really, it seems to
me wrong that there should be any reproach
against scavengers on account of their occupation.
You ladyship will excuse my mentioning
them before you.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“To be sure, Mrs. White, since we both
think them a respectable class, in as far as they
are useful. But they are paid high, as much on
account of the disagreeableness of their business
as its being ill thought of. Plumbers, and
gilders, and miners, and distillers are paid more
than shepherds and gardeners, because their business
is less healthy and agreeable than those
which are carried on in the open air, and in perfect
safety.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, ma’am, I suppose it is all fair and
even in the end; but it seems very much like
chance; for people do not stop to consider the
pleasantness, or the easiness, or the constancy,
or the certainty of the business of the person
they are paying, or the trust they put in him.
They think of no such things when they go to the
play, or buy early strawberries.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“True; there are no such nice distinctions on
all occasions; nor are they necessary; but yet
there is no chance in the matter. When a duke
fees his physician, and his duchess pays her
jeweller’s bill, the nobleman does not calculate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.67'>67</span>the expense at which his physician acquired his
profession, and the long time he waited for practice;
nor does the lady think of the costly stock
of her tradesman, and the delicate nature of his
workmanship; and yet, these are the circumstances
which determine the recompense of each.
If it was as easy to be a physician as a plough-boy,
there would be as many physicians as plough-boys;
and if a diamond necklace required no
more capital and skill than a bunch of asparagus,
there would be as many jewellers as green-grocers;
and then physicians and jewellers
would be paid no more than ploughmen and
green-grocers.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But, my lady, we do not want so many
physicians as ploughmen.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“True; and it is therefore a very happy
thing that fewer can be the one than the other.
If we leave the rewards of labour to take their
natural course, we shall find that there always
turns up a larger quantity of the sort we want
most, and a lesser quantity of the sort we want
least. In profits, I suppose, Mrs. White, you
find less variety than in wages. It is of wages,
you know, that we have been talking since we
began about the apothecary.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Why, my lady, there is a disagreeable and
an agreeable way of making profits of stock;
and there is, I am sure, much more risk in some
cases than others.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes; but there is no consideration of the
easiness or the difficulty of selling things, or of
the trust put in the seller, as there is in the manufacture
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.68'>68</span>of the thing sold. A smuggler, or any
other kind of speculator, may make more one
month, and lose more the next, than the regular
trader pretends to calculate; but, I fancy, if we
were able to see into the affairs of all the people
in this village, or in any town, we should find
less difference in what people make from an
equal amount of stock, than from an equal quantity
of labour. Your rule, of double interest
being fair profit, shows this.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Certainly, my lady; or there would not be
steady sellers of so many kinds of stock. People
would choose the most profitable; which they
might do more easily in selling goods than making
them. My husband shifts his labour, as I
believe he told you, from one employment to
another;—(well for him that he can!) And I
should shift my little capital from one kind of
goods to another, if there was any real and lasting
difference in the profits they would bring. But
I don’t find that crockery would bring higher
profits than grocery, and so I go on being a
grocer; and the butcher down the street finds
he makes as much of his joints as I of my stuffs,
one time with another; and if he did not, I
suppose his wife would turn draper.—We all find
means to live; though I am sorry to say our
profits are lower than they were; and if all my
good father said be true, they will be lower still
ten years hence.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Is that the sexton?” inquired Letitia,
seeing an old man pass with a large key in his
hand. It was, and John White must be going
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.69'>69</span>to see if all was right in his lordship’s pew, as
the sexton was evidently about to open the
church. Letitia paid for her purchases and followed,
as one of her objects was to see the
church as well as the sexton. Several neighbours
popped into Nanny’s shop before she had cleared
her counter, to hear what the lady could have
been saying and doing all this while. Nanny
looked rather grand and mysterious, chiefly
observing upon the comfort of having got somebody
into the neighbourhood that one might
speak to with some chance of being understood.
She was a lady of sense and learning....</p>

<p class='c001'>“Though she did not go to school to your
father, Nanny.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“If she did not, she went to school to somebody
that taught her to respect what my father
taught me, neighbour; and so far, there are some
folks that might take a lesson from her.”</p>

<p class='c001'>On this, the wink went round, and the neighbours
dropped off, leaving Nanny to muse on
what fancy could have possessed her husband to
tread on her toes and twitch her gown when she
spoke of the strolling players.</p>

<hr class='c015'>

</div>

<p class='c017'>The old sexton pursued his way to the church
without looking behind him, though made aware
by the bustle around that strangers were in
his rear. It was not old Joel’s way to alter his
pace or his purposes for man or woman, be they
who they might. Children only had any power
over him; and they only as long as they were
unconscious of it.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Is the sexton one of the equality folks?”
asked Letitia of White.</p>

<p class='c001'>“What, old Joel? Really, madam, there is
no saying what he is, further than that he is discontented
with everybody’s ways of thinking in
turn.—Joel! Joel!” he cried, as the sexton was
busied in unlocking the white gate of the churchyard,
“my lady asks if you are an equality
man.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The old man muttered something unintelligible
while engaged with the lock; but when he looked
up and met Letitia’s eye, her countenance,—not
its beauty, but the sincerity of its expression,—acted
as a charm upon his reserve. They exchanged
smiles, and understood one another immediately.
Joel did not, like Nanny White,
congratulate himself aloud on having met with a
congenial companion, but he felt himself happy
in having done so.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2.71'>71</span>“Will you please to tell me, madam, what
you are here for?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“To see the church, and to make acquaintance
with you, Joel.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Because you are curious about my way of
thinking?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I have no idea what your way of thinking
is; but I should certainly like to know, because
it is the first thing I try to find out when I
make new acquaintances.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Then, madam, you and I shall suit. If such
is your custom, you will not do as the world for
the most part does; you will not first suppose
that a man must be wise for having gone through
all the chances and changes that can be crowded
into a long life, and then think his opinions very
wicked or very foolish because they may be such
as you did not look for. Why, say I, should I
feel and think like you? Have you been first
young and then old? Have you been looked
upon as a scholar in your prime and an oddity in
old age? Have you been on the other half of
the world, and have you now only the sunny side
of a churchyard for your range? Have you had
ten children round your table, and do you now
come to eat your solitary crust upon their graves?
If not, why should you expect me to think like
you? And how will you dare to point at me
and pity me because pain and pleasure have
sharpened my mind’s sight to pierce further into
things than you, who, may be, see only the
outsides of them, or, may be, only the mists that
cover them? Follow me, madam, unless your
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.72'>72</span>limbs are more feeble than an old man’s, as
many a fine lady’s are.”</p>

<p class='c001'>As Joel turned to lead the way, White ventured
upon a sly wink to the lady, but presently fell
behind, abashed by the steady gravity with which
it was met.</p>

<p class='c001'>The church stood on a mound, and its tower,
therefore, though of moderate height, rose conspicuously
above the trees which belted the
churchyard; and from its parapet might be
obtained a glorious view of the surrounding
country. Joel did not pause or speak till he had
conducted Letitia and Thérèse out upon the leads.—Instead
of fixing her attention on the nearer
beauties of the park and village which lay stretched
beneath, the uplands that rose beyond, and the
towers and spires of the great city which might
just be discerned on the western horizon, Letitia
gazed eagerly towards the south, where a dim
haze stained the blue of an autumn sky.</p>

<p class='c001'>“It is ... is it possible? ... yes, it must
be the sea!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“What is it you see, my lady?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I see a faint yellow strip of beach, and an
even grey line which must be the ocean. O
yes! there is a sparkle, and no other light or
motion can be seen so far.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Aye,” said Joel, laughing, “that is ever
the way those pronounce who have seen little.
What think you of volcano fires, my lady, quivering
over two hundred miles of a midnight
sea? What think you of an avalanche sparkling
as it slides from the highest pinnacle of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.73'>73</span>Andes? There are things, for that matter, that
you have seen. What think you of the northern
lights, or of our own shining, changing moon?
Is she not so far off as yonder sea?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I was rash in what I said, Joel. But I wish
that mist was away that I might find a sail.
Look, look, Thérèse! Is there anything?...
Do you see any form come out from amidst the
haze?”</p>

<p class='c001'>Thérèse not having fixed her sight so long,
could discern nothing; but her mistress satisfied
herself that a vessel was visible, and at length,
by dint of attention, could make out first the
hull, then the sails, then one, then two more
vessels in its train, and at last, a whole fleet.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Why do you not insist on your servant
seeing them too?” asked the old philosopher.
“’Twould be just as reasonable as quarrelling,
as the people do down below, about what they see
with their minds’ eyes. Bring them up here.
One will say that yonder haze is nothing more
than a blotch upon a bright sky; another won’t
trouble himself to look, but believes it is a
mountain, or a city, or whatever other folks tell
him it is. You, madam, see that within the
mist which interests you more than the whole
landscape besides; but, depend upon it, you will
find plenty of people to assure you that ’tis all
fancy that you perceive anything.”—Turning to
Thérèse, he said, “Now you believe the lady
that she sees a fleet, I dare say?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I do. Madame is not apt to see visions,
and she ever speaks truth. Do not you believe?”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2.74'>74</span>“I do. What a world of trouble it would
save if we had a few people that could discern
as far off, and tell what they saw as faithfully
about things that will outlast the sea; or even
about some notions that will pass away long
before yon fleet has all been sunk, or beaten to
pieces, or decayed!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You mean,” said Letitia, anxious to prove
the old man’s scholarship, “what a pity it is
that there is nobody to look out and tell us what
truths there are holding their course within the
mists in which our systems of religion, and
politics, and science, and—above all—of society,
are shrouded.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes, madam: but, after all, if there were
such, would any believe them? Or, if some did
and others did not, would there not follow a
quarrel? Believe me, madam, (for I know
every man, woman, and child, that lives beneath
the roofs we are looking down upon,) there is
not a spot beyond the belt of this churchyard,—bright
and quiet as all looks, with not a leaf
stirring in yonder woods,—there is not a spot
where human beings are content with each
other,—not a place above the sod where they
can dwell side by side in perfect peace.—Some
even quarrel about what is to become of themselves
and their neighbours when they are laid
under the sod. The children, indeed, tell one
another such tales as it is pleasant to hear about
the pretty place under ground, all cool and green
and daisied, where they are to lie and sleep till
all are gathered together; but as they grow up
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.75'>75</span>and are taken, one to Sir William’s chapel on
the hill there, and another to the meeting-house
in the village below, and another here....”</p>

<p class='c001'>Letitia, perceiving that Thérèse began to look
alarmed about what might be coming, interrupted
Joel with the remark that it would be surprising
if there were not difference of opinion on a
subject so remote from human ken as the modes
of future being. It was far more desirable that
there should be agreement as to what should be
done above ground to make life peaceful and
happy; the most to be enjoyed in itself, and the
fittest possible preparation for a higher and better.</p>

<p class='c001'>“There is full as much quarrelling about this
as about the other matter,” said old Joel.
“There is your own mansion, madam. There,
if I am rightly told, sits lord F——, sighing
over the distresses of thousands, and finding fault
with the management of those that have held his
office before him. In yonder new farm lives a
man who is annoyed by the complaints of his
neighbours on account of his having undertaken
the tillage of some inferior lands, owing to which,
the profits of their several occupations must fall.
In the old abbey farm below, there is discontent
at rents being raised by the same means. In
our village shop, there is jealousy of the neighbouring
co-operatives; and these co-operatives
themselves, congratulating one another as they
do on having found out the road to prosperity,
shake their heads in a very melancholy way over
the impiety of holding lands, and the injustice of
rewarding labour in such a faulty manner as by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.76'>76</span>paying coin. There are much worse things than
these. There is life lost in smuggling contests
on the coast you are looking at; and life wasted
and worn in ill-paid labour in the rich fields
below; and life embittered by hunger and cold
in yonder hovels where the jolly hunt is now
sweeping by. Everybody sees all this, and
everybody boasts that he could cure it. All set
about it in different ways, and nothing is done.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I would scarcely say that nothing is done,”
said Letitia. “Though labour-notes may not
prove so good a circulating medium as gold and
silver, it is something done for any body of men
to have become practically convinced that it is
labour which gives value to what we would
exchange. Though it is not at all likely that
property in land will be given up because the
Jews, peculiar in all their institutions, held theirs
under a peculiar tenure, it is something gained
that common attention is turned upon the tendency
of our present system of land-holding, that
so the causes of the increase of this species of
property may be discovered in time to remove
the impediments to a just distribution. Depend
upon it, something is gained by these divisions
of opinion; and the more various they become,
the nearer we are to a better plan of society.
The more quickly opponents demolish the hinderances
set up by one another, the sooner will
the natural laws of distribution be left free to
work.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Why should they not do the thing more
quickly still, madam, by watching the natural
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.77'>77</span>course of things? There might be an old man
found in every village able to tell the changes
that have come to pass since his boyhood in the
value of the property, and the prosperity of the
people around him, and wise enough to separate
what belongs to the matter from what does not.
I, for my part, can prove that our people here
would not have been richer if they had paid one
another in labour-notes or goods, instead of
coin; and that if all the people within five miles
round had made an agreement fifty years ago to
have everything in common, there would now
have been less wealth within these bounds, and far
more people to consume it,—though we have too
many already.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Point out to me, Joel, any spot within sight
where you have watched the operation of the
natural laws of distribution, of which we hear so
much.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Alas! madam, there is no such spot in this
kingdom. If there were, there would be abundance
and content everywhere, instead of the
differences we have been talking of. What is
the first of these laws? That all labour should
be free and voluntary.—Well; our people are
not slaves, it is true; but can labour be called
voluntary as to its amount, when a man must
work sixteen hours a day to get just enough to
keep him from starving?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“This comes of there being more labour than
food; and this therefore cannot be remedied by
equalization of property, since the rich man
consumes little more food than the poor man.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.78'>78</span>It can be remedied only by bringing in more
corn, or by sending out a portion of our surplus
labour from among us.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“True. Well; the second law is that all the
fruits of labour should be secured to the producer.
This is not done; for taxation swallows
up a grievous portion of what is produced.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But the labourer chooses to exchange part
of the fruits of his labour for the sake of the protection
of a government.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“The third law,” interrupted Joel, “is that
all exchanges of these fruits ought to be free
and voluntary. Let our labourers give something
in exchange for social protection, and
welcome; but never tell me that they would willingly
give as much as is now required from
them in taxes, unless food was allowed so to
abound as to afford a better recompense to their
toil. While government checks the supply of
food, the labourer cannot think the wealth he
creates naturally distributed between the government
and himself.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“The co-operatives propose, I believe, to go
on tilling more and more land as more food is
wanted, and to give a sufficiency of its produce
to every labourer.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Aye, madam, and many besides the co-operatives;
but it would puzzle the wisest man
among them to say where the sufficiency is to
come from, after a time; the return from land
being less and less as time passes on. Take the
worst soil at present tilled....”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Or a better soil, subtracting the rent; for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.79'>79</span>the return from all land is equal when the rent is
deducted.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Very true, madam. The produce is to be
shared between the cultivator and his labourers,
rent having nothing to do with the profits of the
one or the wages of the other,—being the consequence
entirely of the different qualities of the
land. Well; let this produce be divided into
wages and profits in what proportion you will,
both decline as numbers increase and more food
is wanted.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“How is it then that farmers’ labourers have
many things in their possession that farmers’
labourers used not to have? More shoes and
stockings, and cloth coats, and other manufactured
articles?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Because these things are more easily made,
and cost less. A labourer may now have a pair
of shoes for half as much corn, we will say, as
he must have given for them some years ago.
The same is the case with the farmer who
employs him; so, though each may receive
double the quantity of certain goods that they
did some years ago, it does not follow that the
rate of profits and wages is increased. If you
reckoned the labourer’s gains in shoes, you
might say that his wages are doubled; but if you
reckon them in relation to the farmers’ profits,
you may find them at the same time lowered; or
that both wages and profits have in one sense
increased; in another not. This blinds many
people to the fact that wages and profits are continually
declining.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2.80'>80</span>“Of course, if land produces less and less,
there must be a smaller produce to divide between
the capitalist and his labourers; and on the
whole, they must share the decline pretty equally;
since the farmer would not farm unless he could
make some profit, and the labourers would not
labour but for subsistence. But I am afraid this
decline pulls down the profits of manufactures
too; for farmers would turn manufacturers if
they could make higher profits thereby; and
then there would be a new demand for corn; the
price would rise; farmers would return to farming,
and would take in new land, the diminished
produce of which would lower profits again.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes, madam: this is the way that agricultural
profits determine all profits; and that all
are perpetually sinking. You see labour becomes
dearer when corn is; that is, the labourer must
have a certain quantity of corn in return for his
labour, be its price what it may; and these
higher wages lessen profits again, without any
advantage to the labourer.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, but the corn the farmer retains is
higher in price.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But less in quantity, my lady; and he has
the prospect of employing dearer labour for a
less return.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It seems, then, as if wages determined
profits, instead of profits determining wages.
But I suppose it comes to the same thing where
there are only two shares to depend on each
other.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“There are greater changes, madam, in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.81'>81</span>supply of labour than in the manner of using it;
and while there are multitudes of eager, hungry
labourers, they will take care that the profits of
stock shall not commonly rise higher than just to
make it answer to the capitalist to carry on his
business.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But do these things actually take place? Do
farmers turn manufacturers, and turn back again
into farmers? and have you known any cases of
their profits falling?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I am as sure of it, my lady, as the co-operatives
themselves, whose theme it constantly is.
As for farmers changing,—you must remember
that almost all capitalists use borrowed capital,
and that this capital floats about continually, and
is taken in where it is most wanted: so that
capital may be largely invested in one concern
at one time, and another at another, without
much visible change in the occupations of capitalists.
As for the other matter,—I know a
manufacturer in yon city, and the farmer in the
abbey farm to have each employed ten men at
25<i>l.</i> wages per annum, the highest they could
afford to give, they said, since they had now to
pay 250<i>l.</i> instead of 200<i>l.</i>, as formerly. A new
man came and took new land of the old farmer’s
landlord; and he had to employ eleven men to
raise the same produce as the abbey farm yielded,
and the price of corn rose. When the old
farmer’s lease expired, he was charged 25<i>l.</i> more
rent to make him equal with the new farmer.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“So they paid 275<i>l.</i>,—one for wages only,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.82'>82</span>and the other for wages and the additional rent;
while the manufacturer paid only 250<i>l.</i>”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes; but it was made up to them by the
increased price of their produce; so the profits of
all were still equal. When labour should become
dearer in consequence of this rise of price, the
profits of all three would fall together.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And the labourer would not be better off,
after all, Joel: only the land-owner, whose rent
is incessantly rising. All this is exactly what
the co-operatives are complaining of, is it
not?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes, madam. But how would co-operation
mend the matter? However the total produce
is divided, it still goes on lessening, while numbers
increase. This is the point, my lady. Do
away as you will with the very names of rent,
profits, and wages,—throw all together in a lump
into a public treasury,—and there will still be less
and less return to capital, and more and more
consumers to divide it. Co-operation, equalization,
and all those things, cannot make all
lands equally fertile, they cannot make capital
grow as numbers grow; and unless they could
do these things, they can make no permanent
provision for unlimited numbers; they cannot
prevent the decline of profits, whether those
profits are taken by individuals, or thrown into
the common stock.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But how do you answer these co-operatives,
Joel, when their complaints of the distresses of
our peasantry are undeniably true?”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2.83'>83</span>“I answer by agreeing with them so far.
Who can help it, for that matter? Where is
the town in this wide kingdom where hunger
does not stalk ferociously through the streets,
and howl in the dark alleys? Where is the
village where want does not wet the mother’s
pillow with tears, and open untimely graves for
the gentle and the manly? No, no! I have
seen too much to deny what so many are suffering:
but this only makes me the more anxious
that false means of relief should not be tried.
When I hear some crying out for this park of
yours, my lady, to be cut up into corn-fields and
potato-gardens, or for cultivation to be carried to
the tops of yonder hills, or for all property to be
held in common, I see that all this would only
lead to tenfold misery, and I cry,—but nobody
listens to an old man,—get corn whence you
can get it cheapest;—send away as many of
your people as you do not want to where they
are wanted;—and take care so to manage matters
as that you may never be overburdened with
numbers again.—Often as I have said this,
madam, I never before said it with so much hope
of being attended to. My lord can speak so as
to be heard from one end of the empire to the
other, and....”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And he likes to hear whatever is said from
one end of the kingdom to the other on these
matters, Joel. He would fain have a wise old
man out of every town and village, as you say,
to relate the changes he has seen from boyhood
till now. You must come one day soon, when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.84'>84</span>lord F—— is at leisure, and tell us more of
what you have seen at home and abroad.”</p>

<p class='c001'>As they descended into the church, John
White was seen standing at the entrance to the
gallery in a state of great impatience. He had
been kicking his heels, tapping the door-posts
with his rule, and amusing himself in sundry
such ways for half an hour, while waiting for the
party, and now hastened forward to do the
honours of her pew to lady F——, pointing out
the comforts and elegancies of fire-place, cushioned
chairs, curtain, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Is this our seat?” said Letitia. “I do not
like it at all.”</p>

<p class='c001'>White stared in amazement. Thérèse was too
busy remarking the bareness of a Protestant
church to take notice of what was going on.</p>

<p class='c001'>“It is a small, inconvenient church,” added
Letitia, “and by no means made the most of.
Where do the school children sit?—What!
down in that narrow corner? This gallery is the
proper place for them. After all your trouble,
White, we must have another arrangement.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And where will your ladyship have all these
things shifted?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Nowhere,” replied she, smiling. “If a fire-place
is wanted here at all, it is for the half-clad,
and not for those who can wrap themselves in
furs; and this show of damask furniture does not
beseem the place. I will speak to lord F——
about a pew for us next that of the curate’s
family, and fitted up in the same way.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“With matting underfoot, my lady, and dark
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.85'>85</span>green cushions, and below stairs too? Well to
be sure! But your ladyship will have a curtain
hung round?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I see no use in it. Lord F—— does not
sleep at church, or wish to be supposed present
when he is not.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And the earl, and lady Frances,” said Joel,
in a whisper. “What will they think, my lady?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“They will, as our guests, be satisfied with
our accommodations, Joel. And now show me
down, that I may go and arrange this with lord
F——, that our pew may be ready by Sunday.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“The old family monuments, my lady.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I will wait to see those till lord F—— is
with me. We will call for you, the first morning
he is at liberty. Meanwhile, there is much
to study in the churchyard. We shall meet there
sometimes, Joel.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The lady and the old sexton did often meet
there. Sometimes she went, sketch-book in
hand, to sit in the porch or on the tombs; and
then old Joel kept on the watch, just within
sight, in hopes of being beckoned and invited to
a conversation. At other times he would be
there first in the performance of his duty; and
the lady, warned by the passing bell, would come
down and watch the process of grave-digging,
gathering from him many a tale of joy and sorrow;
many a touching notice of repented sin;
many an animating narrative of struggling virtue.
Severe as old Joel was on the follies of the present
times, no one could review the past more
tenderly. It was soon perceived, however, that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.86'>86</span>he became less reserved in his conduct, and less
severe in his judgments towards the neighbours,
as his friendship with lady F—— ripened. By
the time he got to call her “my dear,” he had
grown so familiar with one and another as to
express his admiration of her. It was a pretty
sight, he observed, to see her out riding with a
train of noble guests about her, and a pleasant
thing to hear that she was the gayest and fairest
at all the lordly festivals in the country round;
but it did an old man’s heart good to have her
come and watch the opening of graves, in which
she never forgot that the young and graceful are
often laid before the old and weary. She ever
kept herself in mind of this, by coming as she
did, to mourn at every funeral. It was not idle
curiosity, as some people might think. There
was her face to read her thoughts in; and where
were thoughts ever written plainer? Let the
train behind the coffin be as long as it might,
there was not a face more serious, there were not
any tears more ready than hers. The very
children that used to be sporting upon the graves
at such times, had learned to be quiet without
her even holding up her finger. Who should
dig his grave, the old man did not know; but
he prayed his hour might come when the lady
should be at the hall. She would see him laid
under the sod, he was sure; and perhaps, at the
moment, some things might come into her mind
that they had said together at times when things
are said that are worth remembering.</p>

</div>

<p class='c017'>Lord and lady F—— found, as all people find,
that drawbacks and trials attend the most exact
fulfilment of wishes. Lord F—— had power,
was conscious of usefulness, and was therefore
freed from the discontent with himself and his
position which had tormented him from his college
days till now; but new trials came with
office. Not only toil, perplexity, and difficulty,
but the relinquishment of pursuits which he
loved, and the deprivation of much of his wife’s
society. She felt this deprivation yet more. It
was painful to know that he was in his study,
and to be obliged to spend three-fourths of the
day alone; but she had also to bear to have him
called away suddenly, and to be disappointed of
his return day after day.</p>

<p class='c001'>On one occasion, some weeks after they
settled themselves at Weston,—this happened
while their abode was full of guests, among
whom were the earl and lady Frances. Lord
F—— was called to town,—believed he might
have to go farther,—could not tell how soon he
should be able to return. The first two days
passed heavily away,—not to the guests, who
enlivened the country round with their outdoor
sports, and the rumours that went abroad of their
indoor revelry,—but to the wife who was far more
busy watching for Henry’s return than playing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.88'>88</span>the hostess, gracefully as she filled her office.
The happiest part of her day was when shut in
with her father-in-law in the library, or reading
in her boudoir, or taking her solitary morning
walk when her guests were dispersed whithersoever
their pleasures led them.</p>

<p class='c001'>One day, about noon, having watched for the
cessation of a heavy shower, she went out with
the first returning sunbeams, and took her way
towards the ruin, with her sketch-book in her
hand, as usual. She was quite alone, this being
the hour for Thérèse to go to her priest, and
Letitia not caring to be attended by any one with
whom she could not converse. The grass was
too wet to allow her to sit down to sketch, and
the place too beautiful, glowing in the mellow
light of an October noon, to allow her to wander
elsewhere in search of a subject for her pencil.
She seated herself on a stone in a sheltered
corner of the ruin, and began, while studying the
perspective of an arch, to take notice of the
trilling of a thrush which was hid among the
ivy. As often as the bird ceased, she mimicked
its note, to incite it to begin again; and with
such success, that the bird and the lady were
presently engaged in a very noisy and merry
duet, answering, following one another, out-trilling
each other, till the nook rang again. In
the midst of this, Letitia suddenly stopped,
fancying she saw a slow-moving shadow among
the ivy at some distance. She sprung up, and
looking through the arch, saw that some one
was leaning on the sun-dial, with his face buried
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.89'>89</span>in his hands. She retreated, without another look,
further into the recess where she had been
sitting, believing the stranger more likely to
think himself unobserved than if she were to
show herself in the open space round the ruin.
Hearing no sound of footsteps near, she hoped,
after a few minutes, that he was gone, and began
to draw; but, before long, she perceived that he
was leaning against the wall at some distance,
and gazing fixedly at her. The moment she
saw his face, she knew him, though he stood
within the shadow.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Mr. Waldie!” she exclaimed, “what brings
you here?”</p>

<p class='c001'>He approached, and sat on the ground at her
feet, without answering.</p>

<p class='c001'>“What brings you here?” repeated Letitia,
in her quietest tone, perplexed by the expression
of his countenance.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Indeed, I scarcely know. I can get no rest.
I felt I must go somewhere, so I came here. I
thought I should find you; and it was just what I
wished, to meet you without going to the house.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Maria—the children—are they well, or has
anything happened?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“All well yet: but something will happen
soon. Letitia, I am on the verge of ruin.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I thought as much. Then why are you
here? Lord F—— is absent, and I cannot help
you. Away and be doing, Mr. Waldie! Do
you quit your home, and saunter about here,
when you are on the verge of ruin? Is this wise?
Is this manly?”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2.90'>90</span>“I cannot conceive what made me come,”
cried Waldie, starting up. “But I suppose it
was because I was afraid to stay where I was.
O Letitia, tell me what to do, for my head is so
confused, I can devise nothing;—go with me
and I will hasten home!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“What are your difficulties? What way of
escape is there? Tell me all, or I will advise
nothing.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Tell you all! When have I not done so?
Do not you——are not you——have not you
always....”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Tell me the whole, brother, as you would
tell your wife; or hasten back, and save her if
there be yet time.”</p>

<p class='c001'>With more distinctness than Letitia had hoped,
Waldie explained to her that he had been engaged
in several speculations, all of which, except one,
the largest, and still undecided, had turned out
badly. Upon this one, everything now depended;
and its only chance of success rested upon several
thousand pounds being raised within two
days. He had bought up the whole of certain
kinds of India spices which had yet arrived in
the market; another cargo, the last of the season,
was daily expected to arrive; and upon its
purchase depended the price of the commodity,
and the returns to the capital he had invested in
it. This was no time for reproaching him with
the folly of such a speculation, or his weakness
in wandering down into the country, and leaving
his fate to be decided by chance. His credit, he
declared, was exhausted; he had no further securities
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.91'>91</span>to offer; he did not know which way to
turn himself; and so he had left the whole affair
behind him. “O for lord F——!” thought Letitia:
but she did not even know where he was this
day and would be the next; and the post which
was to tell her would not arrive till the evening.
She suggested all the ways she could think of to
raise money; some of which were received with
a melancholy smile, some with a painful laugh.
Confused as Waldie seemed to be, he admitted
clearly and repeatedly that if furnished with securities
for the amount required by noon the next
day, he had great hope of being able to obtain
it at more or less cost. This decided Letitia
what to do. She made distinct memoranda of
the particulars, promising that they should be
communicated to no more than one adviser; she
desired Waldie to hasten back to town, without
a moment’s delay, in order to commence the negotiation
for funds, and promised that some one
from her should meet him at his office in town
at two o’clock the next day, with the necessary
securities, if they could be obtained, and with
news of failure if they could not. She did not
tell him that she meant to go herself; but the
hope of obtaining her husband’s assistance, and
the conviction that Maria must stand in need of
her support, determined her to undertake the
journey. Having, by dint of peremptoriness,
got rid of Waldie, she walked rapidly towards
the house, gave her orders to Thérèse to prepare
for their journey, and to the housekeeper to provide
for the comfort of her guests during the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.92'>92</span>three days of her absence; desired the carriage
to take her up at the east gate in twenty minutes,
and proceeded to seek the earl in that part of the
grounds towards which he was seen last to
wander. She found him reading the newspaper
in the sun, ready to welcome her as he saw her
approach, but struck silent when he observed the
expression of anxiety in her flushed countenance.
She rapidly charged him with her apologies for
leaving home so suddenly and strangely, and
begged to depute her office of hostess to lady
Frances. She then inquired, to the astonishment
of the earl, how she might best obtain legal
advice in a hurry, if it should be necessary, and
whether the earl could put her in the way of
obtaining securities for the required amount
within a few hours. On her promise to take no
step without the advice of her husband or of the
lawyer to whom he would give her an introduction,
the earl furnished her with some valuable
information, wondering all the while what sudden
fancy had possessed her; for he had no idea that
she could have seen any one, or received any
letter, since they parted in the breakfast-room an
hour before.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Time was,” said she, while the earl wrote a
few lines to his lawyer, “when I could have
raised this money by pledging my own exertions.
Now, not all my jewels,—not all my resources
of every kind will avail me so well as three
months of my old profession would do. It is
well Henry has gained power; for I have lost
much.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2.93'>93</span>“Take care you are not tempted to resume it,”
replied the earl, smiling. “You want money,
and the way to get it is open. If you are
tempted, remember how it would dismay Henry
at his breakfast-table to see the announcement of
lady F——’s reappearance. Remember that
though we talked of the peerage taking up the
profession of the fine arts, that day is not come
yet;—nor will it have arrived by the time you
enter the peerage, my dear. Which will be
home first, you or Henry?”</p>

<p class='c001'>Letitia tore a leaf out of her sketch-book,
which she still carried, and wrote a note for her
husband in case of his immediate return. The
earl charged himself with it, as she had no time
to go back and seal it; and putting her arm
within his own, led her to the gate where the
carriage was to meet her. He thought, as
she did, that it was best to avoid the risk of
encountering anybody who might look for an
explanation.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Farewell, my dear,” said he, as the carriage
stopped. “We shall be glad to see you back
again; meanwhile, all success to your measures!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“How good you are to trust me for meaning
something better than folly, as I see you do!”
said Letitia, with tearful eyes. “This looks so
like a madcap expedition!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“When I have seen you do a foolish thing,
my dear, I will believe that you may do another.
Till then, my faith is strong. Nay, give me a
happier smile before you go. Has your power
ever failed you at need? I do not know what
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.94'>94</span>you expect from it, but I will venture to predict
that it will not now fail you for the first time.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Before the carriage had well cleared the gate,
it stopped again at the earl’s command. He appeared
at the window to say,</p>

<p class='c001'>“It never occurred to me to ask whether I
can be of use by going with you. Say that you
wish it, and I am ready, this moment.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You <em>are</em> kind; but I do not wish it:” and
again the carriage rolled on.</p>

<p class='c001'>With a beating heart, Letitia made her
inquiry at the door of her town-house. Lord
F—— was not there. He had gone down into
the country,—(not to Weston),—that afternoon,
leaving a letter to be forwarded to her, which
had been put into the post-office some hours
before. Letitia’s best hope was over. It was
midnight;—too late to go to her lawyer. She
gave orders to be driven to her sister’s, thinking
it better to alarm her a few hours sooner than to
risk any loss of time or of counsel.</p>

<p class='c001'>She carried little new alarm into Maria’s
abode. There were lights seen in the windows,
and Maria herself was up and dressed. This was
the second night that she had not gone to rest,
for it was the second that Waldie was absent
without notice, or any intimation where he might
be found. The unhappy wife flew to the door on
hearing the carriage-wheels. When she saw her
sister and Thérèse alone alight, she assumed a
forced calmness of manner, as if bracing herself
up to bear the worst. Letitia judged it best to
use no disguise, from which Maria had suffered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.95'>95</span>all too much already. Inwardly moved by the
downcast look of perplexity with which the
tidings were received, she told of Waldie’s appearance
at Weston, of his errand,—if errand it
might be called,—and intended return. It was
some relief to Maria to suppose him engaged in
town, providing for the approaching crisis, instead
of being kept away by any of the horrible
causes which she could not prevent from filling
her imagination by turns.</p>

<p class='c001'>The lawyer, Mr. Bland, was—not much to his
content—called away from his breakfast and
newspaper, the next morning, by the ladies,
whom, being ladies, he could not think of keeping
in waiting till he had made himself master
of all the news. Coldly and solemnly he sat
himself down to listen to their affair, and prepared
himself with his snuff-box to get over as
well as he could the tedium of hearing a business
statement from women. He would have cut the
matter short near the beginning, with the assurance
of the impossibility of raising securities
for so large an amount before two o’clock; but
Letitia would not be silenced. She showed that
she understood the case, pointed out the advantage
that might accrue to all parties from the
transaction, and indicated such satisfactory means
of ascertaining whether the speculation could
in reality fail, if the proper funds were provided,
that the surly Mr. Bland was won over to promise
that he would see what could be done;
whereupon the ladies immediately left him, promising
to return in four hours, to convey him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.96'>96</span><a id='corr96.1'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='aud'>and</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_96.1'><ins class='correction'>and</ins></a></span> his securities to the place where the business
was to be transacted.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Where shall we go?” asked Maria. “What
can we do with ourselves for these long four
hours?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“If you have courage to go with me,” replied
her sister, “you will find ample employment for
the time. If not, we part here, and I advise you
to take a country drive to refresh yourself. I
am going into the depths of the city to find up
a money-lender, who has proved a very convenient
help to certain young gentlemen of lord
F——’s acquaintance. One may as well try to
have two strings to one’s bow, since the worst
that can happen is to be laughed at, as women
are every day when they propose to meddle with
business.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Is this the worst that can happen?” asked
the timid Maria. “Do you understand the law
in such matters? I would not have you involved,
Letitia, even to save us.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Trust me for doing nothing that my husband
would not have me do,” replied Letitia. “Will
you come? Our dress tells nothing, does it?
It might belong to anybody, from a milliner to
a maid of honour. Will you trust yourself with
me?”</p>

<p class='c001'>Maria gave herself up to her sister’s guidance.
They quitted the carriage about half a mile from
the house they were in search of.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I know the lane,” observed Letitia, “but
not the number. We must venture a guess upon
the house. I will make no inquiries.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2.97'>97</span>They walked two or three times along the
narrow and dark lane, all the dwellings of which
appeared to Maria equally desolate and unpromising;
but her sister, who had fixed on one
from the beginning, was confirmed in her opinion
by seeing half a pint of blue milk taken in at the
front door, while a fruiterer’s boy, carrying a
covered basket, through whose sides might be
discerned the richest of grapes, turned into a
court which led to the back of the premises.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Blue milk in public for the serving man’s
breakfast,” said Letitia, “and purple grapes in
private for the master’s luncheon. This suits
the man exactly. This must be the place.”</p>

<p class='c001'>So saying, she walked up as the milkman
made way, and asked for Mr. Simeon. The
wizened, sly-looking old serving-man replied
that Mr. Simeon was engaged on business.
Perhaps the ladies had mistaken this place for
the shop in —— street. Only the wholesale
jewellery business was carried on here. No;
they wanted Mr. Simeon, and would wait till he
was at liberty. After several messages backwards
and forwards, the ladies were beckoned
in, with apologies for the parlour not being at
liberty. A dingy wareroom having been passed,
it was next required of them to mount a sort of
ladder into what they supposed would prove a
loft, but was in reality a counting-house, so dark
that it appeared questionable whether any business
could be carried on at any hour of any season
without lamps. Maria would have sunk
down on the first chair, if chair there had been:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.98'>98</span>and in the absence of any, was fain to perch
herself on the high stool, which afforded little
rest for want of a footstool. Letitia, who was
always conscious of inward enjoyment when in
strange scenes and circumstances, peered round
in the gloom to make her observations. It was
well that she kept to herself her remarks on
chests and padlocks, on the flask which stood on
a corner shelf, and on the bareness of the whole
place, which left nothing but the said flask which
could be carried away: it was well that she made
no audible remarks on these things, as some one
was present before either she or her sister was
aware. Mr. Simeon had entered by an unseen
door, and his compliments to the ladies were the
first intimation of his presence. She observed a
manœuvre to get them placed opposite the little
light there was, and disappointed it; being disposed
to reconnoitre the person with whom she
was about to deal. She was surprised to find
him a well-made, middle-aged man, whose countenance,
as far as she could see, corresponded
with his address, which was mild and courteous.
She explained, without delay, that her business
was to ascertain on what terms so many thousand
pounds could be borrowed for a month.</p>

<p class='c001'>On no terms which were not sanctioned by the
law of the realm. Perhaps the ladies were aware
of the law?</p>

<p class='c001'>Letitia replied that the same terms might suit
the present case as had been agreed upon by
Mr. Simeon for loans of five, ten, and forty thousand
pounds, at such, and such and such dates.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2.99'>99</span>This proof of some knowledge of his transactions
caused the money-lender to pause and attentively
consider his guests; after which he
observed, as if half to himself, that debts of
honour were troublesome things, and especially
to ladies, to whom ways and means were less
open than to gentlemen. Letitia supposed that
Mr. Simeon knew best, from the nature of his
business; but she had believed that gaming was
obsolete among ladies. She knew no ladies who
were addicted to play. Simeon’s further remarks
glanced upon unpaid jewellery, the flight of
Chancery-wards to the continent, and divers
other suppositions, all of which were baffled by
one or other sister, who did not choose to allow
occasion for any scandal against themselves, in
case of the present transaction becoming known.
Letitia cut the investigation short by requesting
to look at the statute which regulates the rate of
interest on monies lent, and which she concluded
to be in the possession of a money-lender. It
was brought, and with it a taper, by whose light
Mr. Simeon was enabled to perplex himself still
further about the quality of his fair visitors.</p>

<p class='c001'>“It is an unjust law, madam, a cruel law,
worthy only of the Mahomedans, who call it a
sin to lend monies on interest; but it is the
law....”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And must therefore be obeyed, Mr. Simeon.
The forfeit—‘the treble value of the monies, or
other things, so lent, bargained, &#38;c.’—I wonder
they do not ordain the treble value of silks and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.100'>100</span>sugars to be forfeited when the price rises. As
well one commodity as another.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ah, madam, that would raise the prices unconscionably.
People must have commodities;
and if they cannot get them by a straight-forward
course, they must have their little plans and
managements. There is risk and trouble in such
plans; and for this the planners must be paid.
So much being added, the prices would rise unconscionably.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“That is to say, sir, that we are to pay you
unconscionably, if you can make a little plan to
furnish us with this money. Let us hear your
terms, supposing we can furnish you with unquestionable
security.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Mr. Simeon seemed disposed, however, to
descant a little longer on the hardship of the
law, which not only, he observed, obliged him
to be wary and even apparently rigid in his proceedings,—not
only was a perpetual and most
injurious hinderance in the way of commerce,—not
only showed that the makers of the statute
did not understand the office of a circulating medium,—not
only brought the holy law of Moses
(by which the taking of interest was falsely supposed
to be forbidden) into contempt,—but had
actually brought two charming ladies from their
native regions of refinement into a dark hole
quite unworthy of their presence! He was recalled
to business, and obliged to state the rate
of interest he would receive through one of the
circuitous and safe methods which necessity has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.101'>101</span>invented. He was not sufficiently aware with
whom he had to deal.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Your terms, Mr. Simeon, would suit a time
when money is scarce; whereas you know as
well as I that it is plentiful, and that the rate of
profit has not for many years been so low as at
present.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Mr. Simeon endeavoured to mystify her by
pointing out that the kind of profit in question
had nothing to do with other profits, the lending
of money being an unique case. It would
not do.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Consider interest in what light you will, sir,
it comes to this. Interest is the nett profit on
capital, and that nett profit cannot but be low in
the present state of the market. There is a
money-lending market, as you well know,
though your department of it is discountenanced;
and we are not in such a hurry but we can walk
through it and learn what terms some of your
neighbours have to offer. Our object is gained
in finding that you can advance what is wanted.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Mr. Simeon shook his head, and observed that
the securities were not yet before him, that he
had entered into large engagements already this
morning, and that there were sundry other difficulties
in the way of a conclusion of the bargain.
To which the ladies replied that both parties
had better take time to consider; and that a
messenger should wait on Mr. Simeon at three
o’clock to put an end to the treaty, or conduct
him to the place where the securities would be
waiting for him. To this the man of money
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.102'>102</span>agreed, only requesting to appoint a later hour,
on account of prior engagements.</p>

<p class='c001'>The ladies were urged to refresh themselves
with some rare foreign wine, to accept an escort
home, and to do or permit many other things
which might afford a chance of their revealing
themselves: but in vain.</p>

<p class='c001'>On leaving the place, Maria proposed making
a circuit to join the carriage.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Why?” asked her sister. “We have done
nothing to be ashamed of.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Why then conceal your name?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Simply because it had nothing to do with
the business, our errand being merely exploratory;
and it might have altered the terms in a
way injurious to your husband. Now that our
errand is done, let them follow us and see who
we are, if they like.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But the errand itself!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Is anything but a pleasant one, certainly;
but my conscience is at ease as to my share of
it. We keep the letter of the statute, you know,
and that is enough. No one is bound to keep
the spirit of a bad law, since evasion is the only
means of bringing on its repeal. As for the
usury laws,—they have been repeatedly condemned
by committees of the legislature; and
the more they are evaded, the better is the chance
of getting rid of them. Do not you see this?
Do not you see that perpetual evasion of any law
is a sufficient proof of its badness?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You have such courage!” exclaimed Maria.
“All I wish for is to get through life as quietly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.103'>103</span>as I can, and bring up my children to do the
same.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Beware of teaching them <em>blind</em> obedience,
Maria,” said Letitia, when once more seated in
the carriage; “your girls equally with your son.
Obedience, by all means; but a rational, discriminating,
and therefore loving and hearty obedience
to the public laws as well as to those of
your own house. Your little ones will learn
hereafter that your object in forbidding them to
set foot on the hearth-rug in your absence, is to
guard them from being burned. Let them learn
at the same future time the purposes of the laws
under which they live, that they may be ready to
do their part in that renovation of the system
which is required as years roll on. If you
would not have your children retain a superstitious
dread of a hearth-rug through life, neither
would you have them cling to laws enacted in
the infancy of the state, and inappropriate to its
present condition.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Implicit obedience is at least safe,” observed
Maria.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Safe to a certain point, but no farther. If
you continue the law of the hearth-rug for twenty
years to come, your obedient children will never
be burned by crossing it; but do you suppose
they will not by that time have discovered other
means of getting the warmth they wish for?
They will creep under it; they will creep round
it; they will jump over it. So is it, and so
should it be with absurd, antiquated laws.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2.104'>104</span>“Who is to judge which are absurd and which
sound?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“The bulk of the subjects of them. A sound
law can never be evaded by more than a solitary
simpleton here and there, against whom society
will rise up; since it is the paramount interest of
society to keep good laws in effectual operation.
When the time comes for the bulk of society to
approve and enforce the usury laws, you and I
will pay no more visits to Mr. Simeon. Till
then, or till their repeal, let there be opposition
to the spirit and grudging obedience to the letter,
unless we are prepared for the consequences of a
breach of both.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Not I, nor, I hope, anybody belonging to
me,” replied Maria. “O, Letitia, what o’clock
is it? I cannot trust my watch.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Far enough from two o’clock, my dear. So
you will not be amused, even with talk about the
usury laws. Well? I will keep all drowsy subjects
to lull you to sleep with to-night, when all
will be settled;—all redeemed, I trust; and
when you will own at last that watching has
nearly worn you out.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Mr. Bland looked as immitigably solemn as
ever, when he appeared at his own door on the
carriage stopping. He would have had the ladies
wait the result at his house; but Letitia’s business
was not finished till she had ascertained
whether Simeon’s help would be wanted or not.
Mr. Bland was obliged to let his law papers be
tossed into her lap, and to edge in his stick and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.105'>105</span>portly person as well as he could. He had been
busy since the morning interview, and had fully
satisfied himself in the matter of the spices; but
he said to himself, while being whirled along,
that the affair could hardly be brought to a satisfactory
conclusion, since a woman had so much
to do in it. If it had not been for the Earl’s recommendation
of the case, he would have eschewed
the whole matter; and the oddest thing
was that his lordship did not say whether he was
himself informed of the particulars.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Is Mr. Waldie here?” inquired the trembling
wife, in a choking voice, of one of the clerks,
who appeared when the carriage stopped.</p>

<p class='c001'>“He is, madam; but particularly engaged at
present, except——”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Except to this gentleman,” said Letitia,
handing Mr. Bland’s card with her own, which
brought an immediate request that the party
would alight.</p>

<p class='c001'>Mr. Waldie was in the act of shutting somebody
into an inner room when his wife appeared
at the door. He looked pale and worn, but
composed and active. He received his wife and
her sister as if nothing extraordinary had happened,
stated that the money would be forthcoming
if the securities were so; and went straight
to business with Mr. Bland.</p>

<p class='c001'>As soon as satisfied that all was likely to be
well, the ladies proposed to withdraw into the
inner room, and await the issue.</p>

<p class='c001'>“That room? No; not there, my dear,” said
he. “Yet you will not mind my other man of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.106'>106</span>business being there. He will not be in your
way long.”</p>

<p class='c001'>So they were ushered into the apartment where
stood—Mr. Simeon.</p>

<p class='c001'>“You will be saved the trouble of another
excursion at four o’clock, Mr. Simeon,” observed
Letitia. “We have only to regret having consumed
some of your time already this day. You
will hardly see us again till we have debts of
honour to pay, or a Chancery elopement to provide
for.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Mr. Simeon considered himself a gainer by
the transaction in proportion to the honour his
poor counting-house had enjoyed; an honour
the more precious for its being confined within
his own breast. He knew his duty too well to
reveal what had passed.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Do as you please about that,” replied Letitia.
“You and Mr. Waldie must agree about your
keeping Mr. Waldie’s secrets; but, for my part,
I have none. You owe neither honour nor duty
to me, aware, as you no doubt are, that I did
not come to borrow money on my own account.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Mr. Simeon merely mentioned the temptation
of talking about the affair, because it was really
an extraordinary case. Not that it was a rare
thing for ladies to want money; but that they
usually employed agents to procure it. How
indeed should it be otherwise? since not one
woman in five thousand understood even the forms
of business; and these solitary exceptions were
in a class which had no dealings with moneylenders.
On this, followed a series of narratives
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.107'>107</span>of fair ones’ difficulties for want of cash, which
amused Letitia exceedingly, from the romance of
adventure which was mixed up with the most
sordid borrowing transactions. The heroines
were only A. B. and C.; but they became real
personages in Letitia’s imagination on the instant;
and she was almost sorry when Mr. Simeon was
called into the next room to review his securities
and perform his promises.</p>

<p class='c001'>It seemed an age before Mr. Waldie threw
open the door, announcing that all was well. He
briefly thanked Letitia for having saved him;
urged them to return home and rest from their
anxieties; and was only sorry that he could not
accompany them, or even promise to follow them
for some days, as he should be incessantly occupied
till the expected cargo was secured. He
perceived that his wife’s countenance fell on hearing
this, and rallied her; asking what there was
now left to be afraid of?—She did not know,
but——</p>

<p class='c001'>“She is worn out,” said Letitia. “I will take
care that she shall recruit herself, and wait
patiently, unless you try her too long.—You may
be quite easy,” she continued to her sister, when
Waldie’s last grave smile dismissed them. “All
is safe, with him as well as with his affairs.
How calm he is! How entirely himself! He
will speculate no more, believe me.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Maria shook her head, as her tears fell fast.
It was not only that her nerves and spirits were
shaken by what she had gone through. Her
confidence was utterly overthrown, and she felt
the present relief to be no more than a respite.</p>

<hr class='c015'>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_2.108'>108</span>
  <h3 id='ch2.8' class='c020'><span class='sc'>Chapter VIII.</span><br> <br> CONSEQUENCES.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Those who had educated Waldie were partly
answerable for his propensity to speculation,
which arose more from a restless ambition than
from a desire of overgrown wealth. The foundation
of the fortunes of his family was laid by
an ancestor who, a few hundred years ago, introduced
a new manufacture, which he had
learned abroad, into this country. Though, from
having to take workmen away from other manufactures,
and to engage them to learn his own,
he gave higher wages than any of his neighbours,
his profits were also very great, as his article bore
a high price in the market, in the way that new
articles of convenient manufacture generally do.
If profits may be said (as they are by some said)
to be as much the reward of labour as wages,—that
is, the reward of present superintendence,
and of the labour out of which arose the capital
employed, it is certain that this first rich member
of the Waldie family reaped as large a proportionate
reward as his workmen; for long after
their wages and his profits were lowered by his
silk stuffs becoming more common, and the difficulty
of getting workmen being less, he continued
to grow rich from his having more capital to
employ in bringing him profits. If every hundred
pounds did not produce seventy-five, he had,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.109'>109</span>in course of time, for every such hundred, five
that brought 50 per cent., and afterwards fifteen
that brought 25 per cent.; so that he continued
to grow rich, just as individuals and countries may
in these days, if accumulation proceeds faster than
profits fall. His descendants for some generations
carried on this manufacture, for which there
was a permanent demand, and so steady a one
that the variations in its price arose only from
the variations in the prices of other things, and
not from changes of fashion. Now and then the
price of provisions fell, which enabled these
manufacturers to lower their men’s wages, and
enjoy larger profits, till the time came for profits
to fall also; and sometimes the reverse happened,
when the price of provisions rose. Sometimes
complaints were made against the largeness of
their profits, when the fact was that they gave
precisely the same proportion of their produce to
their workmen as before, but there were more
workmen to divide this proportion; which was no
fault of their masters. With these few variations,
the family continued to prosper, being for the most
part content with the ordinary rate of profits, and
making up by continual accumulation for their
gradual fall;—that fall which must take place
wherever the supply of food is restricted. They
were all proud of the ancestor who had founded
the wealth of their family, and sent his praises
down from generation to generation. The present
Mr. Waldie had been early accustomed to
listen to them, and impressed with the idea that
it was time for somebody else to be adding glory
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.110'>110</span>to the family, as it had become much less
distinguished in these times of improvements
than in the first days of its wealth. He quitted
the manufacture, and became a merchant, thinking
that this occupation would afford better
opportunities for the gratification of his ambition
than the straightforward old manufacture. No
wonder he was tempted by schemes which promised
a higher than extraordinary rate of profits!
No wonder he dealt in articles whose extremely
varying prices were determined by other than the
usual circumstances,—which prices he hoped to
catch at the highest, and then to have done with
the article! No wonder that he guessed respecting
such uncertain circumstances as the changes
of fashion, wet and dry seasons, the extent of
particular crops on the other side the globe; and
then proceeded to act upon these guesses! Sometimes
he was right, sometimes wrong. Sometimes
he made five thousand pounds at a stroke,
sometimes lost ten in a season. Much as his
capital was lessened on the whole by his speculations,
this was by no means the worst result of
his proceedings. Like all other gamesters, he
became so fond of the excitement, that, much as
he often suffered from it, he could no longer live
without it; and the domestic influence which is
the most powerful means of winning a man from
bad habits of any kind, was not so powerful in
Waldie’s case as if his first affections had not
been disappointed. Attentive as he always was
to his wife when with her, kind as he had till
lately been to his children, vehement as were the
fancies he took, now to Portugal laurels, now to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.111'>111</span>tall trees, now to bay-windows or new drawing-room
furniture, his happiness was not in his
home, but in the heats and chills of his hopes, in
city news of disasters at sea, of changeable weather,
of new inventions or improvements of manufactured
articles, and of political changes,—of
anything that might affect his speculations. His
poor wife knew nothing for a long while of his
unfortunate ventures, though she heard enough
of exultation over his good ones. She believed
that he must be growing enormously rich, and
sighed over the idea, since it seemed that the
richer he became, the less pleasure he took in
his home. When he first began to alter his tone,
(which he did very suddenly,) when he talked
one day of bringing up their children to provide
for themselves, and moving into a small house
in the city, and the next of purchasing some
splendid estate, and again of giving up his carriages
and sending away half his servants, she
was confounded; not knowing how much to
believe, or to wish to believe; whether to suppose
poverty to be in prospect, or her husband to have
lost the soundness of his judgment. It was
now some comfort to know how their affairs
stood, though she would rather have heard it
from her husband than from Letitia. She had long
seen that Waldie’s family ambition could not be
gratified. Whichever way the scale might turn
at last, whether he left his family in poverty or
magnificence, it was impossible that his memory
should be honoured like that of the ancestor who
had prospered by uniting prudence and industry
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.112'>112</span>with his zeal of enterprise. Whether all was to
be swallowed up in Kentish hops and Russian
tallow, or all redeemed and even doubled by
India spices, those of Waldie’s descendants who
knew his history, would, in either case, pity or
despise him as a gambler.—How much of pity
his fate would call for, not even the most alarmed
imaginations of his timid wife had fully conceived.
She had fancied him, over and over again, in
gaol, in poverty; the idea of suicide even had
flashed across her mind; but that which actually
happened took her more by surprise than arrest,
or ruin, or death by his own hand.</p>

<p class='c001'>Two anxious days were passed by the sisters
in expectation of the decision of Waldie’s affairs,
and still he did not appear. Notes came two or
three times a day from himself or from his clerk,
who wrote at his desire, requesting Mrs. Waldie
not to leave home, as her husband did not know
how soon he might be with her, to take a few
days’ repose on the conclusion of his business.
Letitia heard from her husband also on his arrival
at home, and from the earl, both desiring
her not to leave her sister till she could do so
with comfort; which, in Letitia’s mind, meant
till Waldie should have come home. On the
third morning arrived this extraordinary note.</p>

<p class='c001'>“My own dearest Maria” (substituted for
“Letitia,” scratched out)</p>

<p class='c001'>Coming, coming, coming, as rich as Crœsus!
Light the bonfire. Ring the bells. Hurrah!
Spices for ever! Coming, coming, coming!</p>
<div class='c022'>F. W.”</div>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2.113'>113</span>“I do wish Waldie would control his spirits a
little,” said Maria, showing the note to her sister,
and then looking as if she would fain have withdrawn
it. “How can he bring himself to write
in such a way?”</p>

<p class='c001'>Letitia had nothing to say at the moment; not
even congratulations on the wealth of Crœsus
having crowned all these vicissitudes. She asked
for the children. They were gone out with
Thérèse and their own nurse-maid. She offered a
turn in the shrubbery; but Maria was not, she
presently saw, strong enough to walk. She
threw open the bay-windows, and beckoned her
sister to come and be refreshed by the feel of
the mild autumn air, the bloom of the autumn
roses, and the tranquil beauty of the green prospect.
There they sat, watching and working,
letting drop a few words now and then, but
keeping up nothing like conversation, and looking
out as often as a horseman might be seen
through the trees, or a carriage heard in the
road. At last, the sound of a horse’s hoofs
reached them, far too rapid for safety, they were
sure; and immediately Waldie was seen on
horseback, approaching at tremendous speed,
with something white before him, which proved
to be his two elder children.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Mercy! Mercy!” cried his wife, putting her
hands before her eyes.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Thank God! the gate is open. They are
in! Safe!” exclaimed Letitia, as the horseman
wheeled round the corner and up to the window,
checking his steed so suddenly as to throw it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.114'>114</span>on its haunches, setting the pebbles flying in all
directions, and mingling his loud hurrah with the
laughter of the younger child, who saw nothing
but fun in all this. The elder one was convulsed
with terror.</p>

<p class='c001'>It was well some one was on the spot; for
Waldie threw down both the children as if they
had been mere bundles of clothes. They were
caught,—not, however, without so much slight
bruising as called forth their cries to add to the
confusion.</p>

<p class='c001'>“O Waldie,” shrieked his wife, “what are
you about?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Look, look, look!” he cried, flourishing his
whip over his head, clapping spurs to his horse,
and trampling the beds, walks, and lawn alike,
and finishing by making his horse leap high and
still higher shrubs. He finished by fixing his
eye upon the greenhouse, as if he contemplated
a leap there too.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Mr. Waldie,” said Letitia, in her steadiest
tone, “what are you doing?”</p>

<p class='c001'>In a moment he was off, had flung the bridle
on the neck of the sweating and trembling horse,
and was by her side, swearing deep oaths that
she had ever governed his life and ever should
govern it. With her in wealth, as with her in
poverty, he would....</p>

<p class='c001'>Maria had rushed into the house upon this, but
not the less did Letitia by eye, and gesture, and
word, command him from her, and prevail for
the moment. He obeyed when she pointed his
way into the house, and she was still standing,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.115'>115</span>faint in body and spirit, with the poor children
clinging to her, when Thérèse came in from the
road, breathless, and sinking with terror. When
she saw the children safe, she burst into tears:
she had feared that she might have to answer for
their lives, from not having had presence of
mind to evade Waldie’s vehement desire that the
children should have a ride.—Her mistress gave
her a few directions, which she hastened into the
house to execute, and Letitia, after giving the
servants a charge to take the children into the
nursery and keep them there, repaired to her
sister. She found Maria lying across the bed,
groaning in heart-breaking grief.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Sister!” said she, gently, after watching
silently beside her for a few moments—“Sister,
your husband wants you. He is ill, fearfully ill;
and who should tend him but you?—Nay; why
this despair? A brain fever ... all may be well....”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Letitia; do not deceive me. It is mockery
to attempt it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Maria, if I wished to deceive you, I dare
not. What I have done will prove this. Thérèse
is packing up, and I am going in half an
hour. It grieves me to leave you; but I must
go.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“O yes, yes; you must go.”</p>

<p class='c001'>At this moment, there was a tremendous
knocking at the room door, which was luckily
fastened. It was Waldie, still calling upon
Letitia, who would not answer. Maria dared
not. The knocking went on till there seemed
some probability of the door giving way, when,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.116'>116</span>perhaps from having his attention diverted by
the servants, the madman quitted his object, and
ran down stairs.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes, yes: you must go,” repeated Maria,
bitterly.</p>

<p class='c001'>Letitia could forgive the tone in which this
was spoken.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Listen, Maria, what you must do. Command
yourself, and go and tell the butler that
his master has a brain-fever, and desire him not
to quit your husband’s side but at your bidding.
Have the children kept away, and, if possible,
stay with your husband, looking and speaking
like yourself, till some one comes to relieve you
of your charge. I will immediately send proper
advice and help from town.—Farewell, sister. I
shall not come again till you send for me. As
soon as I can be of any comfort, send. My
husband will wish it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But Waldie will insist on going with you.
He will never let you drive off. He will....”</p>

<p class='c001'>“All this is provided against. I can plead an
errand near the turnpike, and shall go out with
Thérèse by the little shrubbery gate. The carriage
will overtake us. Do not detain me.
Farewell.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Letitia said nothing about removing the children.
She thought that if, as was probable,
Waldie’s state should prove such as to render
Maria’s presence improper, her children would
be her best comfort.—In a few minutes, Maria
saw, but diverted her husband from seeing,
Letitia and Thérèse hastening from the back of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.117'>117</span>the house through the shrubbery, and disappearing
down the road. It was with a strange mixture
of bitter and yearning feelings that the unhappy
wife witnessed such a conclusion as this of a
visit which had been planned and endured for
her sake.</p>

<p class='c001'>There was ample time in after years for the
sisters to explain, and forgive, and renew the
confidence which had been unshaken till this day.
Waldie was never more an impediment to their
intercourse. He was kept under close restraint
from the hour after Letitia’s departure, when he
insisted on searching every corner of the house
for her, and was frantic at having sought in vain,
up to the moment when, after years, first of
madness and then of imbecility, death released
himself and his friends from the burden of his
existence.</p>

<p class='c001'>More than once Maria tremblingly asked the
confidential physician whether her sister’s presence
was likely to be of any service; and
almost rejoiced to be answered with a decided
negative.</p>

<p class='c001'>It was perfectly true that Waldie had become,
as is commonly said, as rich as Crœsus. But
what to Maria was all the splendour in which
she might have henceforth lived, if she had so
chosen? What to her was the trebling of the
fortunes of her children? As a compensation
for the love which had been disappointed, the
domestic hopes which had been rudely overthrown,
these things were nothing, though there were
some in the world who called them prosperity.</p>

</div>

<p class='c017'>Lady F—— remained a few hours in London to
learn the physician’s opinion of Waldie’s state,
and to give notice at home of her approach.
She had no rest, in town or on the road, from
the visions which haunted her of what she had
lately seen. Waldie’s countenance of fierce
glee was for ever before her; his raised voice
startled her imagination perpetually. She had
no repose till her husband met her some miles
from Weston, suffered her to alight at the park-gates,
and invited her to wander with him to the
ruin, and through the autumnal woods, to her
beloved seat beside the stream that fed the lake.
Refreshed and composed, she joined her guests
at the dinner table, and was warmly welcomed
back again: not the less so for no one but the
earl and lady Frances having an idea what had
caused her absence. All were ready with that
delicate homage which may be supposed to have
been as gratifying in its way to Letitia as it is
to many who relish a grosser flattery than she
would ever endure. All were ready with tidings
of her protegés, from pheasants to men and
women. One could assure her that a very
favourite plant had not suffered from the frosts of
the night after she left Weston. Another had
tasted the cream of her dairy; a third admired
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.119'>119</span>her bantams; a fourth amused himself with
Nanny White; a fifth conversed with the old
sexton; and lady Frances herself condescended
to hope that that good girl, Thérèse, had not
been left behind in London. She was such a
treasure! Thereby hung a confession, afterwards
given in private, that Philips was really very
much spoiled, and becoming a great trouble.
Her manners were anything but improved, to
say nothing of her temper. Miss Falconbridge,
whom she knew to be as intimate as a sister
with lady Frances, had taken a fancy to lady
Frances’s style of hair; and as the easiest way of
gratifying her, lady Frances had ordered Philips
to dress Miss Falconbridge’s hair the day before;
whereupon Philips sent word through Miss Falconbridge’s
maid that she must beg to decline
the honour! Lady Frances had insisted, and
her maid in some sort obeyed: but never was
anything seen so absurd as the young lady’s
head. What was lady Frances to do? To part
with Philips was altogether impossible; and to
bear with her now was scarcely less so. Letitia
could not answer for what she should do if compelled
to retain such a person as Philips: she
could only appeal to her own management of
Thérèse as a proof of how easy a matter it is to
make a valuable friend out of a hired attendant.</p>

<p class='c001'>“O yes! by taking the trouble of educating
her, no doubt. But that is a task I could not
submit to. That reminds me—how does Thérèse
get on with politics? I remember her one day,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.120'>120</span>so eloquent about the revolution her father
remembers, and the prospect of another revolution,
and the glory of having seen Lafayette.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“She knows more than she would probably
have learned in the very heart of Paris. She
has left off assuring me that all the kings of
France have been royalists.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I suppose it is for the sake of keeping her
innocent of some things which lady’s maids learn
soon enough that you let her read and talk politics
as she does?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Partly; and partly with a more direct view
to my own interest. It will be of very great
consequence to me that she should be, not only
pure in her conduct, but well educated up to as
high a point as I can carry her.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ah! you mean for the sake of your little
heir. I see Thérèse is as busy about the preparations
as if she had taken her office upon her
already. But you began your care of Thérèse from
the day you knew her, she tells me.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I did; and so I should do still, if there
were no heir in prospect. Should I be justified,
think you, in placing any one where I myself
order the circumstances which are to form her
character, and at the same time neglecting to
order those circumstances well?—It is perfectly
true that, in engaging servants, we undertake a
great task. In the case of Thérèse, however,
the task has been all pleasure.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, for your reward, I suppose you will
keep her always. You will not let her marry, I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.121'>121</span>conclude; or, if she marries, will insist on her
remaining with you. It would be too hard to
lose all your pains.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Whenever Thérèse loves,—and I think I
can trust her to commit no folly with that sound
heart of hers,—she shall marry; and she shall
enter upon her new state as I entered upon mine,
with the view of being all and doing all for
society of which that state admits. This may
best be done by being wholly her husband’s, and
a fixture in his home. I shall surrender my part
in her on her marriage day.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“By which, I suppose, you hope to retain at
least half her heart, if none of her services.
But, my dear, what a prospect for you!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“A goodly prospect indeed, either way.
Either a friend at hand, and a fit guardian of my
children in my absence; or a successful experiment
in happiness-making, ever before my eyes.
I hope ever to rejoice in Thérèse.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Lady Frances sighed, and began to ponder
whether, even if she could learn to live without
Philips, she could make to herself a maid in
whom she might rejoice.</p>

<p class='c001'>Not only from her husband did Letitia learn
how welcome she was back to Weston. The
days of her absence had passed like other days, when
people who prefer the town, and whose lives are
formed for that destination, are thrown together
in the country. There were means of enjoyment
in abundance; but not of a kind to be permanently
relished by those before whom they lay.
Letitia’s music was wanted in the evenings;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.122'>122</span>Letitia’s conversation, artless and sprightly as a
girl’s, rich as a matured woman’s, and entertaining
enough to suit everybody, was sighed for
at table, and when it rained, and especially when
the ladies were called upon to amuse each other
in the absence of the gentlemen. It was only
on rare occasions, however, that she relinquished
her privilege of reserving several hours of the
morning for herself and her husband. On one
desperately rainy day, she was found ready for
chess or music before dinner; and at another
time, when all the gentlemen were absent for the
whole day at a political meeting in the neighbouring
city, she did not leave her guests at all.
But these occasions were rare. On the last-mentioned
one, she had some view to her own
interest as well as that of her guests. Lord
F—— meant to speak at the meeting; his speech
must, from his office, be one of the most important
of the day; and he was doubtful both how
he should acquit himself, and how that which he
had to say would be received. Letitia was, of
course, far from being at ease, and was glad to
conceal, and to carry off some of her anxiety at
the same time by being “on hospitable thoughts
intent.” It was the last day of the last of her
visiters; the gentlemen having waited only for
this meeting. Their carriages were ordered for
the next morning, and they did not return till
late at night.</p>

<p class='c001'>They were nearly as eloquent in describing
the effect of lord F——’s speech, as, by their
account, had been the speech itself.—One swore
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.123'>123</span>by his soul that it was the most good-natured
sort of thing he had ever heard in his life:
another, that the government and the government
candidate ought to feel themselves much obliged
to him; another, that lord F——’s constituents
would be more proud of him than ever; another,
an M.P., a representative of the commercial
interest, that lord F—— had enlightened the
people not a little on the question when low profits
were harmless, and when bad things, and why;
and all, with the earl among them, that this day
might prove the beginning of a new era in lord
F——’s public life. He would now have as
potent a voice out of the house as his friends had
ever hoped he would in time have in it.</p>

<p class='c001'>“How happens all this, Henry?” asked Letitia,
aside, with a glowing smile. “You gave
me no expectation of anything like this.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Because I had none myself. The charm
lay in the burden which I adopted from our
neighbours down in the village;—‘for each and
for all.’”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I see; I understand. Now leave the rest
till you can give it me all in order.”</p>

<p class='c001'>It was accordingly given, all in order, when
the last carriage had driven off, the next morning,
and Henry and Letitia shut themselves
into the library, to enjoy the uninterruptedness
of the first fall of snow. This was no day for
the approach of deputations, for the visits of
clergyman, lawyer, lady callers, gentleman loungers,
or even petitioners from the village. The
guests had been urged to stay for finer weather;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.124'>124</span>but, as peremptory in their plans as people of
real business, provided change of place is the
object, they could on no account delay an hour;
and, to be sure, the snow signified little to any
but the postilions and the horses.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, now, the speech, the speech!” cried
Letitia.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I told the people that nobody doubts that
changes are wanted, in order to remedy the evils
so large a portion of society is justly complaining
of; and that the thing needed is a wider agreement
as to what those changes must be, and
therefore a sounder and more general knowledge of
the causes of existing evils. I led them, as an instance,
into the consideration of the common complaint
of low profits and low wages, and showed
them, I hope, that proportional wages are much
higher at present than some complainers suppose;
the fact being lost sight of from the enormous
increase of those among whom the wages-fund
is divided. However little each labourer may,
from this cause, obtain for his own share, the
division of produce between capitalist and labourer,—that
is, the proportion of profits and wages, is
more equable than is supposed by capitalists who
complain of their low profits, and labourers of
their low wages. Neither of them will gain by
demanding a larger share of the other, which
neither can afford. They must look elsewhere
for a remedy; and I directed them where to look
by giving them the example of Holland and its
commercial vicissitudes.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Rich to overflowing in the fifteenth century;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.125'>125</span>since, well nigh ruined. How was this? From
too much capital leaving the country?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“From the causes which led to such transfer
of capital. While Holland was accumulating its
wealth, profits were first high, and then gradually
lowered in proportion to wages, though still increasing
in total amount. It was not till heavy
taxation reduced the rate of profits below that of
other countries....”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But does not taxation affect wages too?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Assuredly; but the labourer uses fewer commodities
than the capitalist, and therefore there is
a limit to the labourer’s taxation, beyond which
taxes must fall on profits, and reduce them as
effectually as a deterioration of the land could do.
Well; this being the case in Holland, more than
in the neighbouring countries, Dutch capital
flowed into those countries; and the Dutch have
engaged largely in the carrying trade, in foreign
funds, and in loans to the merchants of other
countries, because all this capital could be less
advantageously employed at home. No country
need or ought to come to such a pass as this;
for, where there is an economical government,
taxation may be a trifle compared with what it
was in Holland after the wars of the Republic;
and where there is a liberal commercial system,—that
is, no unnecessary check upon the supply
of food, accumulation may proceed to an undefinable
extent without an injurious fall of wages
and profits. Thus may the cultivation of poor
soils be rendered needless, the consequent rise of
rent be checked, and the fall of profits and wages
obviated.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2.126'>126</span>“What we want then is, a regulation of the
supply of the labour-market, a lightening of
taxation, and a liberal commercial system. But,
Henry, where is the eloquence of all this?—that
which is commonly called eloquence? It seems
to me more like a lecture than a speech.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And so it was; but these are days when, to
the people, naked truth is the best eloquence.
They are sufferers; they look for a way out of
their sufferings; and the plainest way is to them
the fairest. However, I said to them much that
there is no need to say to you,—because you
know it already,—of my views of what the spirit
of society ought to be, in contrast with what it is.
I enlarged,—whether eloquently I know not,—but
I am sure fervently,—as fervently as ever
any advocate of co-operation spoke,—on the rule
‘for each and for all;’ showing that there is
actual co-operation wherever individual interests
are righteously pursued, since the general interest
is made up of individual interests. I showed
that justice requires the individual appropriation
of the fruits of individual effort; that is, the
maintenance of the institution of property; and
that producers do as much for all, as well as for
each, by carrying their produce to market themselves,
as by casting it into a common stock.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“For instance, that A. does as great a public
service by bringing a hundred hats to exchange
for tables and stockings, and whatever else he
may happen to want, as B. by letting the exchange
be conducted as an affair of partnership.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2.127'>127</span>“Yes. Let people have partnerships as large
as they like, and make savings thereby, if they
find they can. But let them beware of the notion
that any competition but the struggle for food is
the cause of hardship; and that struggle must
take place under both systems, unless the same
means are used by both to prevent it. As for
the question of time, the struggle will take place
soonest under that system which affords the
least stimulus to productive industry. “And,
now, love, you have the pith of my speech,
except of those best parts which you have many
a time rehearsed to me, and I to you. Of the
‘hear, hears,’ and clappings, you learned enough
last night.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I wish I could have been there,” sighed the
wife.</p>

<p class='c001'>“So do I. Well as you know the aspect of
an attentive crowd, you can have little idea of the
stimulating excitement of political meetings just
now.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I can imagine it. The true romance of
human life lies among the poorer classes; the
most rapid vicissitudes, the strongest passions,
the most undiluted emotions, the most eloquent
deportment, the truest experience are there.
These things are marked on their countenances,
and displayed by their gestures; and yet these
things are almost untouched by our artists; be
they dramatists, painters, or novelists. The
richest know best what is meant by the monotony
of existence, however little this may appear to
their poor neighbours who see them driving about
as if life depended on their speed, and traversing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.128'>128</span>kingdoms and continents. Yet from the upper
and middling classes are the fine arts mainly
furnished with their subjects. This is wrong; for
life in its reality cannot become known by hearsay;
and by hearsay only is there any notion of
it among those who feel themselves set above its
struggles and its toils: that is, by the greater
part of the aristocracy.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Thank heaven! not by you or me,” replied
her husband. “An uninformed observer might
think that there is monotony before us at present,
sitting as we are, watching the snow-flakes fall
with the few leaves which had lingered aloft till
now,—with weeks of retirement in prospect, and
nothing apparent to wish or work for. Yet you
have had enough, love, of struggle and toil to
know what real life is; and I have, of late, begun
to learn the same lesson. No fear of monotony
for us!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“No fear; since there are all to live for as
well as each, and each other. But, Henry, how
is it that there is so little made known where it
most wants to be known, of what real life is when
trained by that best of educations, vicissitude?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Because our painters of life do not take into
the account,—in fact know little of,—some of the
most important circumstances which constitute
life, in the best sense of the word. They lay
hold of the great circumstances which happen to
all, the landmarks of universal human existence,
and overlook those which are not less interesting,
though not universal. They take Love; and
think it more becoming to describe a Letitia
going to the altar with a lord F——, than a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.129'>129</span>weaver and his thoughtful bride taking possession
of their two rooms, after long waiting and anxiety.
They take Bereavement; and think it the same
thing whether they describe the manly grief of
an Ormond for his gallant Ossory, or the silent
woe of a poverty-stricken widow for her laborious
and dutiful son. They take Birth; and would
rather have a lady F—— bending over the infant
heir of a lordly house, with a Thérèse in
waiting ... (My dear, why not describe that
which shall be as well as that which has been?)—a
lady F—— and her infant, I say, than some
rustic Mary holding up her boy to smile in father’s
face when he comes home from the plough.
There is no harm in all this, provided the mighty
remainder is not overlooked, which is at the
bottom of the most portentous heavings of society,—which
explains all that is to many unaccountable
in the doings of the world they live in. If
the aristocracy cannot, by their own experience,
get to know all that life is,—though they are
born, love, marry, suffer, enjoy, and die, let
some idea be given them of it by true images
held up in the mirror of their studies.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes; let humble life be shown to them in
all its strong and strange varieties; not only in
faithful butlers and housekeepers,—in pretty
dairy-maids and gossiping barbers. Let us
have in books, in pictures, and on the stage,
working men and women, in the various periods
of their struggles through life. In the meanwhile,
these people should in fairness know that
the aristocracy are less aware than is supposed,—less
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.130'>130</span>than they will be,—of what is being done and
suffered on each side of their smooth and dull path.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Let the artists be compassionately considered
too, I pray,” said lord F——, smiling. “Granting
all that can be urged about their limiting
their choice of objects, let us be considerate till
they have placed themselves at large. What,
for instance, could a weaver of fiction make of
our present life?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Nothing of a story; only a picture; there
being, as you said just now, apparent monotony
without, and deep stirrings within. Such a
writer, if wishing to make a narrative, must take
either my former life,—its perplexities, its
poverty, its struggles under its first publicity, its
labours, its love, and migration into a new state;—or
your future one,—the statesman’s honourable toils,
joined with the patriot’s conflicts and
consolations.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But if there was good reason for taking up
precisely the interval,—from our marriage till
this hour;—what then?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Then writer and readers must be contented
with little narrative; contented to know what
passes within us, since so little happens to us.
Would there be nothing to instruct and gratify in
pictures of our position, in revelations of our
hearts, and records of our conversations?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Let us comfort ourselves, Letitia, with
deciding that it must be the fault of the recorder
if there were not.”</p>

  <h3 class='c013'><i>Summary of Principles illustrated in this volume.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c023'>The produce of labour and capital, after rent
has been paid, is divided between the labourer
and the capitalist, under the names of Wages and
Profits.</p>

<p class='c001'>Where there are two shares, each determines
the other, provided they press equally upon one
another.</p>

<p class='c001'>The increase of the supply of labour, claiming
reward, makes the pressure in the present case
unequal, and renders wages the regulator of
profits.</p>

<p class='c001'>The restriction of the supply of food causes
the fall of both profits and wages.</p>

<p class='c001'>The increased expense of raising food enhances
its price: labour, both agricultural and manufacturing,
becomes dearer, (without advantage
to the labourer:) this rise of wages causes profits
to fall; and this fall brings after it a reduction
of the labourer’s share, or a fall of wages.</p>

<p class='c001'>The fall of profits and wages is thus referrible
to the same cause which raises rent;—to an
inequality in the fertility of soils.</p>

<p class='c024'>It is supposed by some that these tendencies
to the fall of wages and profits may be counteracted
by abolishing the distinctions of shares,
and casting the whole produce of land, capital,
and labour, into a common stock. But this is a
fallacy.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2.132'>132</span>For, whatever may be the saving effected by
an extensive partnership, such partnership does
not affect the natural laws by which population
increases faster than capital. The diminution of
the returns to capital must occasion poverty to a
multiplying society, whether those returns are
appropriated by individuals under the competitive
system, or equally distributed among the members
of a co-operative community.</p>

<p class='c001'>The same checks to the deterioration of the
resources of society are necessary under each
system.</p>

<p class='c001'>These are, (in addition to the agricultural improvements
continually taking place,)—</p>

<p class='c001'>1. The due limitation of the number of consumers.</p>

<p class='c001'>2. The lightening of the public burdens, which
at present abstract a large proportion of profits
and wages.</p>

<p class='c001'>3. A liberal commercial system which shall
obviate the necessity of bringing poor soils into
cultivation.</p>

<h3 id='ch3.1' class='c026'><span class='sc'>Chapter I.</span><br> VINE-GROWING.</h3>

<p class='c017'>It was on a glorious afternoon in July, 1788,
that an Englishman, named Steele, landed on the
banks of the Garonne, a few miles south of
Bordeaux, whence he had come up in a boat on
an excursion of part business, part pleasure.
Steele was settled as a factor at Bordeaux, and
his business was to purchase wines from the
growers, and ship them to his employers in England.
His occupation had brought him acquainted
with almost every vine-grower within
fifty leagues of Bordeaux; and in the case of
one of these, Antoine Luyon, the acquaintance
had ripened into a friendship. Antoine was part
owner of some vineyards on the western bank of
the Garonne, one of which produced claret of a
singularly fine quality,—too good to command
an advantageous sale at Paris, where second and
third-rate wines are in nearly equal esteem with
the first. The produce of this small and rich
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.2'>2</span>vineyard was therefore set apart for English sale,
and had been bargained for by the house which
Steele represented, and the terms agreed upon
for the vintage of the five next seasons. Other
vineyards belonging to the same parties touched
upon this peculiarly favoured one; but not all
the care and pains that could be taken availed to
make their produce better than second or third-rate.
Their aspect was a little more to the east
and less to the south; they were not so perfectly
sheltered behind; and no art could temper their
soil to the exact point of perfection enjoyed by
La Haute Favorite, as this distinguished vineyard
was called. Their produce was, however, as
valuable as that of most of the estates around,
and was in good esteem at Paris, where Antoine’s
partner, his brother Charles, was settled as a
wine-merchant; and where he bestowed as much
pains on the maturing of the stock in his cellars
as Antoine did on its first ripening in the form of
grapes, or their friend Steele on the processes of
fining, racking, and mixing, which were carried
on at his employers’ depôt at Bordeaux. Much
care and skill were required in all these departments
of business; and the young men were
exemplary in both, pursuing their occupation as
a matter of taste as well as of necessity. Steele
watched the thermometer in his cellars as carefully
as Antoine observed winds and clouds; and
their common interest in the welfare of Favorite
quickened their friendship, in one way among
many, by occasioning more frequent meetings
than they would otherwise have thought practicable.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.3'>3</span>Many a trip to Bordeaux did Antoine
contrive to ascertain the effects of heat
or cold on the wines in their third or fourth
season; or to give the alarm if he heard rumours
of buildings being pulled down or erected so
near the premises as to have any influence over
the temperature within: and during the summer,
Steele was wont to go up the river on Saturdays,
and spend the Sunday with his friend Antoine for
the avowed purpose of paying his devoirs to La
Favorite.—There was much to tempt him to
these excursions, if wine had made no part of
his interest, for a fairer territory than that through
which the Garonne held its course was seldom
seen. There were harvests of a more picturesque
growth than even those which embellished
the vineyards. Interspersed with the
meadows which sloped down to the river, were
groves of olives and forests of chestnuts, and in
due season, the almond trees put forth their pink
blossoms amidst the dark shadows of the evergreen
woods. Boats heavily laden with the merchandise
of the Levant, brought hither by
means of the grand Languedoc canal, passed
down the blue and brimming river, or returned,
borne rapidly on the tide, and empty of all but
the boatmen in their red jackets, whose snatches
of song reached the shore on the fragrant breeze.
The cottages of the peasantry were indeed few, and
comfortless in appearance; but the chateaux of
the gentry arose here and there, not half buried
in woods, like English mansions, but conspicuous
on terraces, and rendered in some degree imposing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.4'>4</span>by the appliances of art, which did not,
however, in the eye of the Englishman, compensate
for the natural attractions which a fine
taste would have gathered round them. Even
stone balustrades and fountains, and artificial
terraces, however, as long as they were intermixed
with corn-fields and olive groves, had
charms for one whose residence was commonly
in the city; and in process of time, he began to
contemplate the chateau of the marquis de Thou,
which commanded the vicinity of Antoine’s residence,
with something of the admiration, though
with nothing of the awe, with which it was regarded
by the peasantry round.</p>

<p class='c001'>Whether this admiration was increased or lessened
by the glimpses he occasionally obtained of
its inhabitants, he could himself have hardly determined.
The first time he saw the marquis he
was moved to laughter; but then the marquis was
alone (except the laquais in his rear) sitting bolt
upright on his horse, with his enormous queue
reaching down to the little skirts of his coat,
and his large light blue eyes and pursed-up mouth
giving a ludicrous mixture of vacancy and solemnity
to his countenance. But when the
marquis de Thou was seen parading the terrace
with his beautiful daughter, the lady Alice, by
his side, or following the sports of the field with
a train of the noblesse, assembled in all the grandeur
of feudal array, he who looked insignificant
in his individuality gathered some advantage from
the grace or splendour around him. He was
regarded as the father and protector of the fair
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.5'>5</span>creature who seemed to tread on air within the
vast circumference of her hoop, and whose eyes
shone forth from beneath her enormous head-dress
like glow-worms in a thicket; and again,
the marquis was the host of the wealthy and the
gay who held sway in the land which was for
ever boasting its own likeness to Paradise: so
that, in time, the marquis became mixed up with
his connexions even in the mind of the Englishman;
and instead of laughing, Steele learned to
uncover and bow low at the approach of the great
man, in the same manner as Antoine. If he had
known as much as the natives of the territory of
certain deeds which were done, and certain customs
which were prevalent there, his English
heart might have forbidden his raising his hand
to his head in token of respect; but though he
disliked the French peasantry, he was not fully
aware how many of their bad qualities were directly
attributable to the influence of the order of
which the marquis de Thou was one of the representatives.</p>

<p class='c001'>On the present occasion, Antoine awaited on
the bank the landing of his friend.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ah ha!” cried the Frenchman, as soon as he
could make himself heard; “you look up into
our blue sky with the same admiration as when
you first saw it, four seasons ago. Well; even
Bordeaux has its smoke, and now and then a sea
haze.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“So thick an one this morning,” replied
Steele, “that I could have fancied myself in an
English port.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_3.6'>6</span>“Do the captains foretell a change of wind?”
inquired Antoine. “I rather apprehend one;
and it is a pity that Favorite should risk losing a
particle of her beauty. Come and see her,—as
bright as a May morning; as rich and mellow
as an autumn noon. It would grieve my soul if
an unkind wind should hurt her; but there are
signs of a change.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The young men turned their steps towards the
vineyards, instead of to Antoine’s dwelling, as
Steele needed no refreshment but that of seeing
how his dearly-beloved vines flourished, and enjoying
the beautiful walk which led to the enclosures.
On this occasion, he looked about him
more than usual as he passed, as the peasantry
were abroad, and evidently in a state of excitement
and uneasiness. One and another stopped
the young men to ask if they knew what direction
the hunt had taken, and whether it could be
conjectured how long a chase the boar might
cause the gentry. Steele now learned for the
first time, how eminently a boar hunt was an
occasion of terror and hardship to the country
people. He saw them mount the highest trees
to look out, and lay their ears to the ground to
detect the distant tread of horses. He heard
them mutter prayers that their fences might remain
unbroken, and their crops untrodden.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I should not have thought your peasants
could be so anxious about their little harvests,”
he observed to Antoine. “Judging from the
state of their plots of land, I should suppose them
careless about their tillage. How weedy this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.7'>7</span>field is! And the hay in that meadow was, as I
remember, not cut for weeks after the proper
time.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It is no fault of theirs,” replied Antoine. “The
law forbids hoeing and weeding, lest the young
partridges should be hurt; and the hay must not
be cut before a certain day, let the season be
what it will, lest the game should be deprived of
shelter. Many crops are thus spoiled.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“What tyranny!” exclaimed the Englishman.
“But some fault seems still to remain with the
cultivators. They do not use half the manure at
their disposal, while their land evidently wants it
much. Yonder field is an instance.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Certain sorts of manure are thought to give
an unpleasant flavour to the birds which subsist
on the grain which springs from them,” replied
Antoine. “Such manure is not allowed to be
used.”</p>

<p class='c001'>On Steele’s exclaiming again that such prohibitions
were too arbitrary to be endured, Antoine
laughed, and wondered what he would say
to certain other regulations, in comparison with
which these were trifles. What did he think of
the lot of those who were sent to the galleys for
having entered or approached the groves where
the wild pigeons of the marquis were appointed
to breed undisturbed; or of such as were ruined
by being taken from their tillage to make for him
ornamental roads which led nowhere; or by the
fines which they had to pay in commutation of
the service of keeping the frogs quiet by night?
On one side the chateau, a marsh extended for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.8'>8</span>some distance, and its frogs greatly annoyed a
former marquis by their croaking. His peasantry
were employed to beat the ponds. By
degrees, as the nuisance decreased, this service
was commuted for a fine,—and a very oppressive
one it was found at this day. Antoine was proceeding
to describe another grievance of great
magnitude, when his description was superseded
by an example.</p>

<p class='c001'>The young men were now in a chestnut grove,
within which the distant sounds of the hunt were
beginning to be heard. A figure of a peasant
crossed the glades at intervals, and an occasional
voice hailed them from overhead, where
lookers out were perched on the loftiest trees to
watch what course the devastation of the boar
and its hunters would take. After a few moments
of quiet, a cry burst forth, and was echoed
from mouth to mouth through the wood, a heavy
plunging tread was heard, and a rushing and
crashing in the thicket, which warned Steele to
fly to the protection of the largest trunk at
hand, while Antoine climbed a tree as nimbly as
a squirrel. The ferocious, clumsy animal immediately
appeared, its small eyes red and flaming,
its coarse hide bristling, and its terrific
tusks looking as if they could plough up the very
ground over which it rushed headlong. The
moment the danger was past, Antoine descended,
and followed at full speed to see the issue of
the chase; Steele keeping up with his companion
as well as he could, but not without some qualms
lest the beast should be met at the extremity of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.9'>9</span>the wood, and driven back upon his steps. The
hunt was a little too late, however, to accomplish
this manœuvre, and Steele began to feel himself
somewhat more comfortable, when a cry of horror
from Antoine, who was a little way in advance,
renewed all his fears.</p>

<p class='c001'>“O, Favorite! O La Haute Favorite!” cried
he. “She is spoiled,—she will be wholly desolated
by the monster and the hunters!” And
poor Antoine threw himself down at the foot of
a tree, and would look no more. His companion
saw one horseman after another leap the fence
which had been kept in such perfect repair,
watched them wheeling round and round among
the choice vines, which they must be treading
like so much common grass, and finally follow
the boar out at the opposite side, while the servants
who attended in the rear wantonly rode
over the same ground, when they might just as
easily have kept the road. In a great passion,
Steele flew to warn, and threaten, and scold;
but before he had time to commit himself, Antoine
was at hand to interpose, and silence the
indignant Englishman.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I cannot conceive what you mean, Antoine,”
cried Steele, the moment they had the place to
themselves. “You flung yourself upon the
ground in as great an agony as if your bride
had been snatched from you; and presently you
come to speak these rascals as fair as if they had
done you a favour!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It is the only way to keep what we have
left,” replied Antoine, mournfully. “There is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.10'>10</span>no use, but much peril, in complaint. Redress
there is none; and ill-will towards the lord’s
pleasure is resented more deeply and lastingly
than injury to his property. You may rob his
chateau of its plate, and be more easily forgiven
than for repining at anything which happens in
the course of his sports.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Steele was ready to burst with indignation
against the people which permitted such usages
to endure. He was answered by a reference to
the cruel old forest laws of England, and certain
national blemishes of an analogous character
which still remained; and the friends were in
danger of quarrelling, for the first time, when
they remembered that it would be more to the
purpose to contemplate the present than the past
and the absent, and to help one another under the
vexatious event which had befallen them.</p>

<p class='c001'>It was mournful to look around, and see what
had been done within a few minutes;—the clean
soil trodden and strewed, the props thrown down,
the laden branches snapped off, the ripening
fruit crushed and scattered, and the whole laid
open to intruders; whether men to steal, or
troops of deer to browze. If, by any exertion,
these intruders could be kept out, there was hope
that some, even a considerable portion, of the
expected vintage might be saved, as some rows
of vines had not been touched, and others had
fallen merely from their supports being removed.
Antoine set off in search of labourers. Not one
would follow him till the issue of the hunt was
known, and it became certain whose fields would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.11'>11</span>be devastated before the sun went down, and
whose not; but when the boar’s head was at
length carried towards the chateau, with the
usual honours, and the proud train returned to
their stately festivities, a gang of peasants, safe
for this bout, set to work, under Antoine and
Steele, to stop up the fences till they could be
properly repaired; while their less fortunate
neighbours hid themselves to groan over the
destroyed harvests which were their only hope;—hid
themselves, because if their own little children
had spoken of their grief, the galleys would
infallibly be their destination ere long. Neither
those who chaunted over their work, however,
nor those who brooded over wrongs within,
nor the two young men who toiled, went home,
and retired to rest in gloomy silence, anticipated
what would be their relative position at the same
hour the next evening. Nothing could now appear
more certain to Antoine than that he and
his brother had sustained a great loss in the destruction
of half the crop of their best vineyard,
or to Steele than that it would be a misfortune to
his employers to be disappointed of half the
quantity of that superlative wine which they were
to have on favourable terms, and might sell at
almost any price they might choose to set upon
it: yet another turn of fortune happened within
a few hours which promised to do more than repair
the pecuniary damage, though it still remained
to be lamented that La Haute Favorite should
have been exposed to wanton devastation.</p>

<p class='c001'>The next day was the day of the extraordinary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.12'>12</span>hurricane which spread affright through various
regions of France, where there was want and
woe enough before to shake the courage and
perplex the judgment of rulers, and to appal the
hearts of the ruled. The timid had long been
inquiring how the national burdens were to be
borne for the future, and the popular discontents
much longer soothed. When this dreadful tempest
came, extinguishing the light of day like an eclipse,
changing the aspect of the scenery like an earthquake,
and convulsing the atmosphere like a
hurricane, mere timidity became deepened into a
superstitious horror, and the powers of hell were
thought to be let loose against the devoted land.
Few could wonder much at this who knew the
people in their state of ignorance and hardship,
and who witnessed the ravages of the storm.</p>

<p class='c001'>The morning had risen fair and bright, though
cold, from the change of wind which Antoine
had predicted. The clouds soon began to gather,
with an appearance of unusual blackness; but
this did not prevent the country people from setting
out for church, and making their way
thither in defiance of the rising blasts. When
assembled, however, they found it perilous to remain
under the shelter of a roof which threatened
to fall in upon them; and they rushed out into
the road, where, carefully avoiding the neighbourhood
of trees, they supported one another during
the dreadful hour that the storm lasted. Cries
of grief and despair broke from them at every
step as they returned homewards. Drifts of hail
stopped up their path. The corn-fields were one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.13'>13</span>vast morass. The almond groves were level
with the ground; and of the chestnut woods nothing
remained but an assemblage of bare poles.
The more exposed vineyards were so many
quagmires, and many dwellings were mere heaps
of ruins. All who witnessed were horror-struck
at the conviction of general, immediate, pressing
want; and the more thoughtful glanced forwards
in idea to the number of seasons that must pass
away before all this damage could be repaired.
Not a few, in the midst of their own distress,
however, jested on the fate of the marquis’s
partridges, and consoled one another with the
certainty that it would be long before the lord’s
game could trouble them again.</p>

<p class='c001'>As for Antoine, he hurried past his ruined
garden to La Favorite, gloomily followed by the
Englishman, who could not be comforted by his
companion’s suggestion, that, at the worst, the
soil would be finely manured by its produce
being beaten into it. This was not exactly the
object for which Steele had anticipated the fine
crop would be used, and he could not, so rapidly
as a Frenchman, acquiesce in so complete a
change of purposes. It would be difficult to say
which was the most astonished and the most joyful
when they found their beloved Favorite smiling
amidst the general devastation, and scarcely
more injured than when they had left her the
night before. Sheltered by the hill behind, and
by a wood on the side whence the hurricane
approached, she had escaped its worst fury; and
a few torn branches, a few scattered hailstones,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.14'>14</span>were the only witnesses of the storm which had
passed over her.</p>

<p class='c001'>“My beauty! My beloved!” exclaimed Antoine;
“though man and beast have dared to
insult thee, the elements have known how to
respect thy beauty. They just paid thee a gentle
homage as they passed, and left thee serene and
verdant, while all besides is prostrated before
them. My homage shall restore the few charms
that have been defaced.”</p>

<p class='c001'>And, somewhat to Steele’s surprise, Antoine
began the homage he spoke of, reverentially
lifting the trailing branches, coaxing the battered
bunches of grapes, and restoring props with a
sort of joyful solemnity, as if rendering service
to one who could appreciate his devotion. The
cooler Englishman meanwhile looked abroad
into the neighbouring vineyards, and saw with
concern that the losses of Antoine and his
brother must be great. Antoine would scarcely
allow this, however, not only because the safety
of Favorite had filled him with joy, but because
he believed that his fortunes would be rather
amended than the contrary by what had happened.</p>

<p class='c001'>“How should that be?” inquired Steele.
“The enormous rise in value of the produce of
this vineyard will not benefit you, but my employers,
as our terms are fixed for five years to
come. How can you gain by being deprived of
the rest of your vintage?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“We shall gain by others being deprived of
theirs. Vast labour will be required to render
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.15'>15</span>these lands productive once more, and the price
of wines will therefore be much raised.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But you will have to employ and pay for
this labour as well as others.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“True; but meanwhile, we have a large stock
of wine at Paris and Bordeaux. For some little
time there has been no demand; for the country
is troubled, and no one will buy more than cannot
be avoided. This has made Charles uneasy,
and he has often lately complained of the largeness
of our stock. Now that there will be a
failure in the supply of wines, our stock will be
in request, and at such prices as shall pay all the
labour of repairs in our vineyards, and leave no
small advantage besides. And then,—how our
grounds are manured! What crops they will
yield!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Aye; but when?—You never will see the
dark side of an affair, Antoine. It will be
three or four years before yon quagmires can
become a firm soil, full of well-settled and bearing
vines.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Meantime, things will become more tranquil
at Paris, perhaps, so that people may enjoy their
wine as formerly.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Some persons,” observed Steele, “would
repine at the terms we have fixed beyond recall
for the produce of Favorite; but I hear no complaints
from you of the large profits which will
be made by my employers.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Where would be the use?” replied Antoine.
“Since the bargain is, as you say, beyond recall,
it is no longer my affair. On the contrary, I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.16'>16</span>congratulate your gentlemen with all my heart.—There
is but one thing that I would suggest;—that
if their gains prove great, they should purchase
the blessing of heaven on them by devoting
some small portion to the peasants here who are
ruined by the same cause which brings your
friends prosperity.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“There will no doubt be a general subscription,”
observed Steele; “and it is fitting that
those foreigners should give who will profit by
the disasters of your country.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“If your gentlemen,” replied Antoine, “will
do it in the form of remitting a portion of Favorite’s
wealth, they will add grace to their
bounty. How graceful will it be in this, our
beauty, to thank heaven for having spared her
charms by giving in alms a portion of her
dowry!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Will your people distinguish, think you,”
asked Steele, laughing, “between alms issuing
from an English merchant’s pocket, in his own
name and in the name of a personified vineyard?”</p>

<p class='c001'>Antoine warmly replied that no people on
earth had so nice a sense of the morally graceful
and sublime as the French; and offered a wager
that in the straightforward case, plain thanks in
prose would be all that Messrs. Mason and Co.
would receive; while, if the moral grace he
recommended were put into the act, La Haute
Favorite would be celebrated in song under many
a clump of elms.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Meanwhile,” said Steele, “what measures
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.17'>17</span>will you take about your private affairs, and how
can I help you?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I will this day write to Charles tidings of
what has happened. To-morrow I will see what
portion of the crops out of this enclosure can be
saved. The produce must be housed at Bordeaux,
and no more transported to Paris this
year.—You can aid me no otherwise than in the
care of Favorite, and in soothing the poor whom
I dread to meet on my way home. Exhort them,
as I ever do, to make the best of inevitable
evils.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Your example will do more than my exhortations.
But what is left to make the best
of?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“The marquis and his daughter. They can
no longer be a torment, and may be a help.
The new works, for which he oppressed the
people, are destroyed. His pigeons are blown
away, and his partridges are drowned; and even
the frogs may be found to be eternally silenced
by this excessive beating of their ponds: while
still the people have an equitable claim for food.
Let us go and comfort them thus.”</p>

<p class='c001'>And the good-natured Antoine carried his
cheerful countenance among the shivering and
dismayed peasantry who were waiting for advice
and guidance, and led them to the chateau to
ask for relief.</p>

<p class='c001'>The marquis laid his hand upon his heart, and
the lady Alice took trinkets from her hair to give
to the hungry people before her, who were loud
in their praises of her condescension; though, to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.18'>18</span>be sure, as trinkets could not be eaten, and there
was nothing eatable for them to be exchanged
against, they only served at present to hush little
crying babies for a minute or two. In time it
was clearly conveyed to the lady that a more
effectual measure would be to order the housekeeper
to distribute the contents of the larder
among the hungry; and to the gentleman, that
now was the occasion for his steward to unlock
the granary. These stores being soon exhausted,
and no more being at once procurable, from the
whole neighbouring country having been laid
waste, the cottagers were obliged to subsist themselves
as well as they could on boiled acorns,
stewed nettles, and on the lord’s frogs; a race
which seemed destined to extermination, man
and the elements having apparently combined
against them.</p>

<p class='c001'>As many of the sufferers as yet survive look
back upon that dreadful time with a horror which
is not lessened even by the political horrors
which ensued. Throughout Guienne, the Orleannois,
and other provinces, not a score of
revolutions could efface the recollections and
traditions of the hurricane of July, 1788. Perhaps
it may be still a subject of dispute a century
hence whether it was charged, in addition to the
natural agents of destruction, with a special message
to warn the French nation of their approaching
social convulsion. Superstition has
not yet been abolished in France, any more than
in some other countries which have suffered less
deplorably from its sway.</p>

</div>

<p class='c017'>Charles Luyon was wont to hasten home at
dinner-time with as much cheerfulness in his
countenance as alacrity in his gait. He always
had a smile ready when his timid wife looked
anxiously in his face, and generally some tidings
which were not bad, when her aged father, M.
Raucourt, asked his invariable question,—“What
news, Charles?” Times were now, however,
altering so speedily that it was evident that
Charles must vary his entré. His smile he was
likely enough to preserve, happen what might;
but in the article of news he began to be perplexed;
for whatever was now stirring was of a
kind with which it was painful to confuse and
trouble a very old man, who never went abroad,
but yet managed to know something of what was
going on by fixing his seat constantly at the
window, and using his eyes, which were less
infirm than his understanding. The children
too, who were old enough to be inquisitive, began
to be very pertinacious in their questions why
their walks were circumscribed, and what was
the meaning of various strange sights and sounds
which they met at every turn. In satisfying
them why the drums beat, and why orators
talked so loud in the mobs, Charles never used
the word riot,—much less rebellion, or revolution,
either of which might have been fatal to his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.20'>20</span>wife’s peace; for she had been bred a royalist by
her father, and had a perfect horror of even a
disrespectful word against the royal family or
the noblesse. What Charles was in politics, she
could never tell. He seemed to adopt no party,
to talk sensibly on what took place before his
eyes, and (judging by what had already come
to pass) to prophecy clearly respecting the
future. He pointed out to her that the people
were starving, and of course disaffected; but
he did not say where the blame rested, contenting
himself with hoping the best, as he did on all
occasions.</p>

<p class='c001'>On the day that he received the tidings of the
ravages of the storm in Guienne, Marguerite did,
for once, perceive a slight shade on her husband’s
brow. The family were standing at the
window, beside the old man’s easy chair, eagerly
gazing into the street, which was filled from end
to end with a mob. The aspect of the people
was terrific, and their clamour, compounded of
the shrill voices of the fishwomen and the more
deep-toned yells of haggard and half-famished
men, was deafening. The old gentleman looked
full of glee, for he had contrived to persuade himself
that all this was rejoicing for some royal
festival. The wiser children looked in their
mother’s face for an explanation; but she could
attend to nothing else when she saw her husband
enter.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Thank God, Charles, you are home! How
did you get in?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I have been in this half hour.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_3.21'>21</span>“And shut up by yourself? There is something
the matter, Charles.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Charles gave in brief the story of the storm,
which included the tidings that certain olive and
almond groves, her own property, were utterly
destroyed.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Charles, Charles,” interrupted the old man,
as soon as the mob had passed; “what news
to-day?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I am afraid what you have just seen tells
only too plainly, sir. The people are gone to
the palace to vociferate for bread.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, well, fashions change,” observed M.
Raucourt. “In my days the king gave away
wine instead of bread.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“If he did so now, sir, it would be a good
thing for my trade. It would empty my cellars
to supply such a crowd as has just gone by.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Does not your wine sell, this year?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Not very well, sir. People buy little of
anything at present; but better times will certainly
come.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But, papa, why do not all these people buy
bread, if they want it so very much?” asked
Julien.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Because there is very little to be bought;
and that little is too dear for poor people to buy.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“So they want the king to buy it for them?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes; but the king says he has no money.
He is borrowing some, however, and I hope the
people will soon be relieved, somehow or other.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Who lends the king money, papa?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I am going to lend him some; and so will
<a id='corr21.34'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='verybody'>everybody</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_21.34'><ins class='correction'>everybody</ins></a></span> else that has any.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_3.22'>22</span>Little Pauline thought it would be the better
and quicker way for her papa to buy the bread
himself for the poor, instead of lending money to
the king to do so. She was told that perhaps the
people might begin to love the king again if he
tried to relieve them; and that his majesty would
be much pleased at this, for they had not been at
all fond of him lately. This news set Marguerite
sighing, and the children thinking what they
had that they could lend the king. Grandpapa
was consulted, while his son and daughter retired
from the window to read Antoine’s letter. M.
Raucourt thought the king would not wish for
Julien’s bird-organ, as he often heard finer music
than it could make, and it would now buy very
little bread; but why it would buy so little, he
could not tell. He recommended Pauline’s
making her offering to the queen;—that beautiful,
graceful lady that every Frenchman worshipped
when she became his queen, and whom every
Frenchman would mourn in the dust when the
time must come for her to die. The old man
was entering upon his favourite long story of
the queen’s entry into her capital, when Pauline
stopped him with an enquiry whether this beautiful
lady would like to have her silk-worms, and
how much bread they would buy. As soon as
grandpapa could speak for laughing, he told the
child that the queen carried more silk on her
head at that moment than these worms would
spin in a hundred years. The little dog Joli,
with his collar and silver bell, was next proposed,
and thought more eligible. Joli was called, and
looked for in vain under sofa, and chairs, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.23'>23</span>behind mamma’s harp. While Pauline went in
search of him, Julien interrupted papa to know
why his bird-organ would buy very little bread,
when it had once cost so much money.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Money enough, papa, to buy many loaves of
bread.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes, my dear; because the men who made
that organ ate up several loaves of bread while
they were at work upon it; and it was necessary
to pay themselves for that bread, as well as for
the wood, and the steel, and the brass, and the
wear of their tools.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Then would not people eat as much bread if
they made another bird-organ to-day?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes; and such an organ would cost me twice
as much money as I gave for yours last year. It
would buy only the same number of loaves, however,
because each loaf costs twice as much
money as it used to do.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But grandpapa says my organ will buy very
little bread.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“True; because it was made when bread was
cheap; and an organ made to-day would be
made when bread is very dear. I gave the organ-maker
money enough to buy twelve loaves; and
now the same money would buy only six loaves.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And perhaps six loaves would not be enough
for the people while they were making the organ?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Certainly not. They must have twelve;
and so I should have to pay twice as much for
another organ made to-day as you could sell
yours for, supposing it as good as new.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But why is not there more bread, papa? I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.24'>24</span>should like that there should be so much that I
might give the people twenty-four loaves when I
give the king my organ.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“When that time comes, my dear, the people
will not want to beg bread, and you shall have a
better present to offer at court.—But, do you
know, Julien, there is going to be less bread
than ever, I am afraid.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Marguerite drew her little son to her, and described
to him the state of the peasantry round
uncle Antoine’s vineyards; and how grandpapa’s
olives were all blown down, and everything eatable
destroyed, except what had hitherto been
considered food for swine.</p>

<p class='c001'>“One woman,” she continued, “offered a
comfortable coat of her husband’s to several
shivering people who would have liked it very
much; but they could not give so much as a
single handful of barley for it. There were some
who would have given a whole field for a sack of
wheat; but they could not get it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“One miserly person,” observed Charles,
“happened to save a small stock of cabbages, of
which he was willing to sell three. He was
offered a blanket, and would not take it; and
then a pretty crucifix; and then a clock——”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But perhaps he did not want any of these
things?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Neither could he be said to want what he
took at last. When he found that the highest
price was offered that he was likely to get, he
accepted it; and it was a diamond pin, given by
lady Alice de Thou to a destitute family.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_3.25'>25</span>“Was it like the diamond in mamma’s watch?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Much larger. It was so valuable that, a
month ago, it would have bought uncle Antoine’s
best vineyard.—It bought only three cabbages
now, because the people must have cabbages and
did not want diamonds.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Then the very poor people pay much more
than the rich, I suppose? The poorer they are,
the more they pay?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Not when there is enough of what they
want. The baker over the way knows that if
he charged a poor man too high, the man would
go to some other baker to buy; so they keep
their prices pretty equal. But as soon as there
is too little of what everybody wants, every one
is eager to get his share, and promises more than
his neighbour; till, as we see, a diamond pin
may be given for three cabbages. There is too
little corn in France now; and that is the reason
why we give more for it than will pay the baker,
and the miller, and the farmer, and his labourers
for what it cost them to prepare it for us.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“The same will be the case with your papa’s
wine,” added Marguerite. “He charged yesterday
as much as it had cost him to cultivate
the ground, and ripen the wine, and pay for
having it brought here, and for the use of his
cellars, and a certain sum over for us to live
upon. After to-day, everybody will know how
the storm has ruined the vineyards; every one
will be afraid that there will not be wine enough,
and they will offer more and more for it, till—”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_3.26'>26</span>“Till papa is rich enough to take Pauline and
me to Versailles, to see the court.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Charles told how much money he should want
to get his vineyards into repair again, and what
high wages he must pay the country people,
while provisions continued as dear as at present.—Marguerite
meanwhile sighed, and observed
that there was little pleasure now in going to
Versailles, to hear people, even of the better
classes, criticise the expensiveness of the queen’s
dress, and the haughtiness of her air, as often as
she appeared.</p>

<p class='c001'>Pauline now burst into the room in a state of
wonder and consternation. She had not been
able to find Joli anywhere about the house, and
on employing the servants in the search, had
recovered her favourite in a somewhat different
condition from that in which she had last seen
him. He was found crouching in the street,
just outside the door, no longer the beautiful
animal, with a silky white coat, enamelled collar
and silver bell, but actually dyed, the hind part
red, the fore part blue, with a stripe of white left
in the middle. Instead of the collar, were bands
of ribbon of the same three colours. The poor
animal and its mistress seemed equally terrified,
and both perhaps felt themselves insulted when
everybody laughed. Pauline cried, and Joli
whined.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Is he hurt, my love?” inquired mamma.</p>

<p class='c001'>Julien waved his handkerchief, and Joli
jumped and snapped at it as usual; and even
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.27'>27</span>Pauline laughed through her tears, when she
saw the gaudy little creature frisking about in
masquerade.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Since he is safe,” said Charles, “never
mind the collar and bell. We will get another
when times are better, and there are fewer thieves
about.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“There is something worse than theft here,”
observed Marguerite, sadly. “I abhor those
colours.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Then let us wash them off, if we can; and
mind, Pauline, if you wish your dog to be safe,
you must keep him within doors till his coat is
perfectly white again.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The washing availed little, as the dog was not
besmeared but dyed. To get rid of as much red
and blue as possible, mamma cut off the new collar,
and gave Pauline a piece of white satin ribbon.
Grandpapa helped the child to tie it on, and sent
her also for a white lily,—his favourite flower,—and
fastened it where the bell had been; and
then Joli looked something like a royalist dog
again.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I do wonder, Charles,” said his wife, while
this was doing, “that you go on always talking
of better times coming, and of the fine things
that are to happen by and by. You have done
so ever since I knew you; ever since——”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes, love, ever since the days when you
were so very sure that your father would never
approve me; that my business would never
flourish; that, for one reason or another, we
should never come together.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_3.28'>28</span>“Ah! I was not a cool judge in that case.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Nor I, I am sure, my dear.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You seldom are, if there is any room at all
for hope. Plunge you into an abyss of distress,
and you are the calmest of judges. I would
trust you to find your way in utter darkness; but
the least glimmering you take for daylight. At
this very moment, when you know that all affairs
have been looking more and more gloomy for
these ten years past; when the people are starving
and rebellious, when your trade is almost
annihilated, and my dowry destroyed, with that
of thousands of your neighbours, you still talk of
the good times that are coming.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You think this very senseless, my love, I
dare say?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It <em>is</em> very provoking, Charles. At first
it was always said in the spring that things
would be better in the autumn; and in the autumn,
that all would come right in the spring.
Now, you have somewhat extended your hope: it
is either next year, or by and by, or hereafter;
but still you go on hoping, when everybody else
is preparing.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Cannot one hope and prepare at the same
time?” asked Charles. “It seems to me that
it is for want of this that so much evil now
threatens us. The court goes on hoping without
making any preparation; and the people, having
no hope from the present system, are preparing
to overthrow it too completely and too suddenly.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Mercy!” cried Marguerite; “what will
become of us?”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_3.29'>29</span>“We shall live to grow wise in the experience
of a state of transition, or die, leaving this wisdom
to be inherited by others. In either case, the
wisdom will remain; and the world (including
our children) will be the better for it. Meanwhile,
there is dinner waiting below for those
who are hungry. Do not let the thoughts of
to-morrow spoil the comfort of to-day.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Before the day was over, however, its comfort
was spoiled, and even Charles was compelled to
look anxiously to the morrow. After dinner, a
shriek of anguish was heard from the children.
They had forgotten to secure Joli; and he was
found hung up on the next lamp-post, strangled
in his new white collar, and the lily stuck insultingly
in his mouth. There was no use now
in blaming the folly and carelessness which had
occasioned the catastrophe. The only thing to
be done was to impress upon the entire household
the necessity of parading no more lilies, and
avoiding all ornaments of white, red, or blue.</p>

<hr class='c015'>

<h3 id='ch3.3' class='c020'><span class='sc'>Chapter III.</span><br> <br> THE TEMPER OF THE TIME.</h3>

<p class='c027'>The stagnation of trade was now a serious evil
to Charles, not only as it occasioned his capital
to be locked up, and his income to be impaired,
nor because he was of so active a temperament
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.30'>30</span>that nothing troubled him like the having no
business to do,—but because those were the
safest amidst the troubles of the times who were
supposed to be fully occupied in their private
concerns. There was no lack of interest, indeed,
for the most restless seeker of excitement; and
Charles might have busied himself from morning
to night of every day in tracking the progress of
the public discontent, if such had been the species
of employment he had desired or approved.
He might, like other people, have shouted the
praises of Necker in every street and square.
He might have amused himself with watching with
how many different airs the passengers on the
Pont Neuf submitted to bow uncovered before
the statue of Henry IV., under the penalty of
having squibs let off in their faces. He might
have witnessed the burning in effigy of obnoxious
ministers, and have stood by the great fire into
which the king’s decrees for suspending the
parliament were cast, and have listened, through
the live-long day, to the harangues of popular
orators, or joined in the midnight processions by
which the repose of all quiet citizens was disturbed.
But Charles did not see that such attendance
on his part could do any good at
present, however the case might hereafter be
altered. Whether or not he was turning over
in his mind plans for his conduct when the time
should come for him to act, he now appeared to
direct his attention to private affairs, and talked
more of wine and olives than of political matters.</p>

<p class='c001'>He had been accustomed to furnish a large
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.31'>31</span>proportion of the home supply of olives and
almonds for which there was a demand in Paris,
from the produce of the estates of his wife and
father-in-law; and now he had applications, day
after day, for fruits which he might have sold at
a high price, while scarcely a customer came
for wine. He had already invested the little
floating capital he could spare from the restoration
of his vineyards in fruits from Italy and
the Levant, which his brother purchased for him
as they came up the great canal and the Garonne,
on their way to Bordeaux. He now began to
wish that he could exchange a part of his large
stock of wine for fruits. He knew that wines
would rise enormously in price, as soon as the
demand should revive; but fruits had already
risen enormously, and he wished to turn some of
his capital into money by their means. It was
easy to do this by extending his transactions
with Steele, who purchased fruit in large quantities
at Bordeaux to send to England. The demand
for fruit in London being at present insignificant
in comparison with that for claret, and
the direct reverse being the case at Paris, it was
Steele’s interest to transmit more wine and less
fruit, and Charles’s to take fruit in exchange for
his wine. It was therefore settled that, in addition
to their standing bargain for first-rate wine,
Steele should have a large choice of second-rate
claret, in payment for chestnuts from Spain,
oranges and citrons from the Madeiras, olives
from the Levant, and almonds from Italy. The
terms of exchange were the only difficulty.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_3.32'>32</span>Neither Steele nor Charles were speculators,
in the common sense of the term. They were
prudent men of business, attached to one line of
occupation, and in no particular hurry to be
richer than everybody else. They now, however,
found themselves obliged to speculate, and
became more fully aware than they had been
before that all trading for purposes of sale is, in
fact, speculation. It is necessary for traders not
only to take into account all the past and present
circumstances which affect the value of the
article in which they deal, but to look forward to
such as may influence its sale. Their success
depends on the foresight which they have exercised,
and the sagacity with which they have
calculated: in other words, on their skill in
speculation. When they extend their views to a
further extent than they can command, and
found their calculations on contingencies, they
become gamesters of that class which is held in
horror under the name of speculators: and hence
arises a somewhat indistinct dread and dislike of
all speculation; while the fact is, no exchange
whatever could go on without more or less real
speculation. The farmer must speculate on
the seasons; the manufacturer on tastes and
fashions, and on the supply of raw material; the
merchant must speculate on war and peace, and
all domestic and much foreign policy. In ordinary
times, Charles must speculate on the increase
or decline of the taste for claret, or of the
number of claret-drinkers in Paris; and now, a
new and wide field of calculation was opened
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.33'>33</span>before him, on which he must enter if he meant
to prosecute his business at all.</p>

<p class='c001'>From the time that the brothers had entered
into business till now, there had been established
a tolerably steady rate of understood value, at
which goods had been exchanged for one another.
There had been occasional and slight
variations, according to seasons, and other fluctuating
circumstances; so that four pipes of
wine might at one time exchange for the same
quantity of fruit as three and a half would buy at
another; but the circumstances which determined
these variations in value being usually foreseen
by all parties concerned, their vigilance
prevented any very sudden and perplexing convulsions
in trade. As long as there were average
seasons, an average supply of food, an average
quantity of labour to be had, wages and
profits (on which price depends) could be calculated,
and relied on for remaining nearly at the
average rate. But now, there had been both
natural and political disasters, whose consequences
defied all calculation. There was an
over-supply of labour,—as far as the number of
labourers went; for thousands of the peasantry
had been stripped of all they had, and rendered
dependent on neighbouring capitalists for employment
and support. At the same time, food
was dreadfully deficient, and therefore enormously
dear; so that to what price labour would rise,
in spite of the over-supply, it was impossible to
guess.—The same cause rendered the amount of
profits uncertain. Unless it could be settled how
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.34'>34</span>much the labourers would appropriate, it must
continue unsettled how much would remain over
for the capitalist,—even if it could be ascertained
how extensive would be the demand for the
article. This, again, was doubtful, from the uncertainty
of political affairs, which impaired the
security of property, and stopped up the channels
of mutual exchange. Thus, not only was the
permanent original element of exchangeable
value,—cost of production,—rendered incalculable,
in the case both of wine and fruits, but all
the causes which occasion temporary fluctuations
were violently at work; and it required a clear
head and a strong heart to anticipate and rely
upon their issues. Steele’s part was the less
perplexing of the two. He knew no more than
Charles, it is true, how the sudden rise in the
value of labour, from the scarcity of food, would
affect the price of the stock laid in before labour
became so dear; and he could not therefore
judge of the probable amount of Charles’s profits;
but on the head of his employers’ profits he felt
very secure. The English market was steady:
the demand could be nearly estimated, and if it
was pretty sure to be good with an abundant
supply of wine in the market, it was certain to
be very brisk as soon as the supply was known
to be deficient. Though, therefore, he might
ask less than he need in exchange for his fruit,
there was every probability of his gaining more
than the usual profit on the wine thus purchased.—Charles,
on the other hand, had not only to
discover what expense his brother and other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.35'>35</span>vine-growers were at in maintaining labourers,
and how much of this was to be charged by tacit
agreement upon their present stock, and the
same facts with regard to the fruit; but to speculate
on the ability and disposition of the people
of Paris to buy either wine or fruit, and how
much the demand for the one was likely to fall
short of, or exceed, the demand for the other.—The
result was that the two parties to the bargain
fixed upon an exchange which appeared likely to
be mutually advantageous, but which proved the
value of their commodities to have deviated widely
from the ordinary proportion. Setting off an
equal expense of labour, and an equal amount of
profit, on each side, fifty chests of fruit (from
almonds and citrons down to chestnuts) would
exchange for a pipe of claret, in ordinary times.
Now, twenty chests were all that such a pipe
would buy; and yet Charles believed he had made
a good bargain, as the demand of thirsty orators
for juicy fruits, and of loungers in the streets
for chestnuts, was extraordinarily great, while
wine was, just then, little in request. His wife,
knowing that he had lately been rather pressed for
money, watched with interest the process by
which it began once more to flow in. By half
emptying a cellar in Bordeaux, fruit was made
to arrive in Paris by waggon loads, and these
were presently converted into cash. But there
was one point on which she was not satisfied.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I see,” said she, “the convenience to us
and to the Englishmen of our mutual exchange.
It is really charming; as welcome as the traffic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.36'>36</span>between the first maker of weapons and the
hunter, when the one had more bows and fishlines
than he could use, and the other more
venison and trout than he could eat while they
were good. But, Charles, are you either of you
just in taking advantage of the vengeance of
heaven, he to enrich himself, and you to repair
your losses? Ought you not to sell wine at the
price it professed to bear in your cellars before the
hurricane happened? And why is Italian fruit
dear, when in Italy there has been no storm?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“If we sold our goods at last year’s prices,”
replied Charles, “all our wine and our fruit
would be exhausted long before we should have
a further supply. Is it not better that they
should bear such a price as will make people
sparing in their use till we have once more
an abundance?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And is this the reason why there are granaries
not yet exhausted, amidst the cries of the
people for bread?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It is; and if bread had borne its usual price
all this time, there would now be absolute
famine in every street of Paris. If the people
understood this, they would not storm the flour
mills, and throw hundreds of sacks into the
Seine, in their rage against the owners. These
owners, by causing a gradual distribution, are
the best friends of those who are their own
bitter enemies;—who waste bread now, because
they were not permitted to waste it before.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But why should the corn-owners be enriched
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.37'>37</span>by scarcity of bread, and you by the
destruction of vineyards? You tell me that
your gains by this storm will nearly compensate
the losses it has cost you. Is this fair?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Perfectly so. You know that the value of
every thing that is exchanged depends on the
labour required to produce it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes, yes: and therefore the wine that is
to be grown in your desolated vineyards will
justly be dear, because much and dear labour
will be needed to restore your estates to fertility.
But I speak of your present stock, prepared
when labour was not particularly high
priced, and when only the ordinary quantity of it
was wanted.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“The plain fact is, that labour is now very
dear, everywhere; my cellar-full of it, as well as
that which is now active in La Favorite. You
will hardly wish, my dear, that I should present
the public with a portion of it, in the present
state of my affairs. I am not exactly in a condition
to give away my substance unnecessarily;
especially to buyers of wine, who are, for the
most part, richer than myself. If harps were suddenly
to become doubled in value, you would not
sell yours for what you gave for it, would you?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“No; harp-buyers would be better able to
give the market-price than I to do without it.
Yet——”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yet we have not considered that your case
would be stronger still if it was necessary for
you to buy another harp immediately, at the advanced
price. Such is my case. I sell my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.38'>38</span>cellar-full of labour in order to purchase a further
supply at the present high price. Since I must
buy, and must pay dear for what I buy, would it
not be folly to sell the same article cheap?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“The same article! I do not understand you.
You would be wrong to hire yourself out for the
money wages of a year ago:—to give the strength
of your arm for what would buy much less
bread: but——”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But the wine in my cellars and the strength
of my arm are equally labour, possessed by me.
You may call the one primary, and the other
secondary, if you like; but they are equally
labour. Yes; all the capital we have,—whether
the furniture of this room, or your olive presses,
or my wine, is hoarded labour: the labour of the
work-people from whom we purchased it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“That is curious. Then the price depends
upon the labour——O no, there are your profits
to be considered. The price depends upon the
cost of production; which includes your capital
as well as your men’s labour.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Call it all labour at once, if you like. Profits
are the recompense of labour as much as
wages: wages of primary, and profits of secondary
or hoarded labour; whichever you
please to call it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Then why have you been perplexing yourself
all this time about this exchange of goods
with Steele? Cannot you reckon easily enough
the present value of the labour contained in a
pipe of wine? and will not this serve as a perfect
measure?”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_3.39'>39</span>“Nothing ever served as a perfect measure
of value yet; or ever will, in my opinion,”
replied Charles. “Labour <em>regulates</em> the relative
value of Steele’s fruit and my wine; but it can
never <em>measure</em> the one against the other, or both
against houses, or furniture, or money, or any
other commodity. Do not you see that, while
labour varies as it does, it can never serve as a
measure?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“To be sure, it is very different in its value
this winter from what it was the last.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Suppose our milk-woman exchanged a quart
of cream daily for a pint of coffee, at the coffee-shop
opposite; and that the quart and pint pots
grew larger or smaller according as the air was
damp or dry. These pots would regulate the
quantity of cream and coffee; but it would be
absurd to call them measures, while the quantity
they yield is incessantly varying.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Labour is affected by the seasons, I know;
and it seems as if it must always be so, and as
if there could therefore never be a fixed measure
of value.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Not only does primary labour produce more
at some times, and under some circumstances,
than others, but it is impossible to tell beforehand
what will be the return to secondary labour; and
from this it follows that the shares of the capitalist
and the labourer rise and fall against one another,
so that neither can be depended upon for
steadiness.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well: I suppose we can do without a fixed
measure of value, since we cannot get one; but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.40'>40</span>it does seem as if it would be convenient to
know always exactly how much food and clothing
one might have in exchange for so much money.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I am afraid it would be as mischievous in
one way as having no regulator would be in
another.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“O, if there were no regulator, men would
snatch from one another like wild beasts; and
they would soon be in a very beast-like state as
to property. Food for the hour would be all
any one would think of, if the chances were that
he would get nothing by his labour, or be unable
to keep what he might obtain.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“On the other hand, if there were an unvarying
measure, men would be a wholly different
race from what they are created to be. There
is no anticipating the consequences of withdrawing
all the discipline by which their faculties are
exercised, sharpened, and strengthened. The
very supposition is absurd, however, for it includes
the absence of all human vicissitudes.
Before there could be a true measure of the relative
value of human possessions, man must have
power to keep the whole surface of the globe in
a state of equal fertility, to regulate the sunshine
and the rain, and to ordain all who are born to
have an equal share of strength, both of limbs
and faculties. All lives must also be of the
same length, and even sickness would affect his
measure. No: that degree of sagacity which
can abstract averages is enough of a guide for
practical purposes, while it affords a fine exercise
for the intellect and the moral nature of man.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_3.41'>41</span>Marguerite shook her head mournfully, asking
how much the moral nature of their neighbours
was likely to be benefited by the present uncertainty
of affairs.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Infinitely more than we can estimate,” replied
Charles, eagerly. “I see every day, not
only splendid instances of intellectual effort,
applied to the most important departments of
social philosophy, but moral struggles and self-sacrifices
which dispose me more than ever to
bow the knee to human nature.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And, as usual, you overlook whatever would
not please you. You hear the patriotic harangues
of our new mob orators, but not the abominable
commentaries of those who stand at your elbow.
You join in the shouts with which the national
colours are hailed as often as they appear, but
are not aware how the white cockade is trodden
under foot. You are so taken up with making
your obeisance to the parliament you think so
virtuous, that you disregard the cruel irreverence
with which our anointed sovereigns are blasphemed.
This is not just, Charles; it is foolish;
and, what is worse, it is disloyal.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Nay, my love——”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It is not enough that, by your way of regarding
public affairs, you amuse my father, and
tranquillize me, and encourage in our children
a temper like your own. All this is well in ordinary
times: but these are days for higher objects
and a more intrepid conduct.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Charles looked steadily at his wife, but she
would not yet let him speak. She went on,—</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_3.42'>42</span>“These are days when the true should pray
day and night for vengeance on the false, instead
of excusing them: when loyalty should weep in
dark corners, since it cannot show its face in the
daylight without being profaned. These are
days when our children should see a solemn sadness
in our countenances; and if they ask why,
they should be told in mournful mystery what
sympathy is due to suffering royalty.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And not to a suffering nation, Marguerite?
Is there to be no pride in intrepid patriotism?
No joy in public virtue? Shall the birth of
liberty be looked upon as an evil omen? If the
king had chosen to stand its sponsor, the whole
of our mighty people might have peaceably rejoiced
together. His disowning it is no reason
why others should not hail its advent. His
choosing the part of Herod is reason enough why
there should be priests waiting and watching in
the temple.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You are speaking treason!” cried the terrified
Marguerite.</p>

<p class='c001'>“By no means. I am ready to struggle for
the king and the throne till death; but it must
be for a wise king, and a throne founded in
justice. As it is, all things are made to bear
two aspects, and it is too much to require all to
perceive only one. A forcible division has been
made between the past and the future, and no
wonder that some incline to look forward, while
others persist in a reverted attitude.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ah! how will you reconcile duties in this
perverse state of affairs?”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_3.43'>43</span>“Very easily. When I am in the mob, I
refer the patriotic sentiments of the orators to
the new era of freedom, and pity the indecent violence
of the hearers as the result of their prolonged
subjugation. When heads are uncovered
before La Fayette, my heart glows as in the
very presence of liberty; when the queen is
insulted in the streets of her capital by the
refuse of her own sex, I sigh over the mischiefs
the oppression of ages has wrought, but still
hope that the day of their decline has arrived.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And what when Orleans sneaks away from
the rabble he has maddened? What when every
lamp-post in the Place de Grêve bears its
strangled victim?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I see in one the monstrous offspring of a
deformed and an unformed system. Such a birth
can take place but once, and its life must be as
brief through want of vigour, as it is hateful
from its ugliness. The practice of slaughter too
belongs to the old time. The more degraded
slaves are, the more certain is it that their emancipation
will be signalized by murder.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Why then not control, or at least resist
them? Is it not dastardly to sit smiling at home,
while the loyal and the noble——”</p>

<p class='c001'>Charles lifted up his finger in token of silence,
and rose from his seat, saying,</p>

<p class='c001'>“Your reproaches impel me to a confidence
with which I did not intend to disturb your tranquillity.
Follow me.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Marguerite did so, suspecting that she might
soon wish to retract some things which she had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.44'>44</span>said. Her husband led her to his wine-cellars,
which were at the back of the house, separated
from it by a small court, from which there was
an opening through a wide gateway into the
street. The few servants who remained at this
slack time on the premises were employed about
the fruit-store. The keys of the wine-cellars
were kept by a confidential clerk, who was
always on the spot, and was the only person
besides Charles who now ever entered the place.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Remember,” said Charles to his wife, as he
put the key into the first lock; “remember that
you have brought this disclosure upon yourself.
This will enable you to bear it well. The best
thing we can hope is that you may have to bear
it long. If calamity should shortly release you
from apprehension, you will see that the hopefulness
you complain of in me does not arise
from levity. Pierre, bring the lantern, and lock
us in.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Marguerite felt half-stifled between her fear
of what was to come next, and the close air of
the cellars. Her husband held up the light, and
she saw that the door had been newly plated with
iron. The next thing she was shown was a long
train of gunpowder winding among the stores
of wine and brandy.</p>

<p class='c001'>“O, Charles!” she cried; “are you going
to blow us up?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Not ourselves, or the house either,” he
replied. “You see here is not enough to do
any great mischief;—only enough to bring
down the ceiling upon my wine-casks, and spoil
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.45'>45</span>the wine. There are no buildings over this
cellar, you know; so there is no danger to
human life.”</p>

<p class='c001'>He then explained that, finding how invariably
the worst excesses of the mob were to be
traced to their being plied with drink, it had
occurred to him to engage all the wine-merchants
of Paris in an agreement to refuse, on some
pretence or other, to sell wine or spirits to any
but private gentlemen who wanted it for their
own consumption. Some agreed, and others
did not; and these latter, when they had sold all
their stock, and could, from the scarcity, get no
more, had maliciously whispered in the mobs the
secret with which they had been entrusted. One
after another of the merchants, knowing the
danger to which they were exposed, had fallen
off from the agreement; and Charles, whose
stock was the largest now remaining in the city,
was left almost alone in his determination to
refuse the means of intoxicating the mob. He
was aware that his wine was longed for, and his
life threatened. He could not remove his stock
to a distance, for his premises were evidently
watched by spies. He had reason to believe
that, on the first occasion when the people were
to be excited to an extraordinary act of violence,
they were to be brought hither to burst open his
stores, and be plied with brandy and wine. He
did not choose to be thus made the means of
promoting riot and murder, and determined on
blowing up his stock, if matters came to extremity.
On the first alarm of the approach of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.46'>46</span>mob, he should fire the train, and bring down
the roof; making a pit of what was now level
ground. Or, if he should be absent, Pierre
knew how to do it.</p>

<p class='c001'>“But how?” asked Marguerite, with as much
voice as she had left. “Must it not be fatal to
the one who fires?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I trust not,” he replied; “though, if it
were, my purpose would stand. It is better to
sacrifice one life thus, than to make murderous
fiends of many thousands. But, look here,
this is our contrivance.”</p>

<p class='c001'>And he showed her how a very small trap-door
had been made of one of the stones in the pavement
above, through which a light might be let
down immediately upon the train, and from any
distance, if the line were of sufficient length.</p>

<p class='c001'>“It is but little that a quiet citizen can do in
times when men of a different make are sure to
gain the ascendency,” observed Charles: “but no
one is absolved from doing what he can. I am
no orator to rouse the people to patriotism, or to
soothe their madness; but here I have power
in having something like a monopoly of the poison
which helps to madden them; and it shall
be kept from inflaming their brains, whether
they tear me limb from limb, or compel me to
drown myself in my own wine, or let me live till
the days when they shall thank me for crossing
their will.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Marguerite’s terror was aggravated by a sense
of shame for having failed to anticipate her husband’s
heroism, and being now unable to share
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.47'>47</span>it. Her thoughts were ready to veer any way
in hope of escape, rather than anchor themselves
upon her husband’s determination, and await the
event. No wonder, since she had so much at
stake, and was a very simpleton in political
matters. She had all possible fears, and no
wishes. A miserable state to be in, in such
times!</p>

<p class='c001'>Could not the whole family remove? Could
not her husband, at least, slip away by night?
Must they remain in the neighbourhood of gunpowder,
and in daily expectation of the mob?—actually
within hearing of the hated drums?</p>

<p class='c001'>They must; her husband replied. Any attempt
to fly, or to alter their manner of living, would
be immediately detected, and would bring a
worse destruction than that which they might
possibly escape by remaining. Had not Marguerite
observed spies about the house?</p>

<p class='c001'>O yes: every day since poor Joli was found
hanged. That was a sad piece of carelessness.
Charles thought so too, and even with more
reason than his wife. He knew that the dressing
up of that dog was set down in the list of his
sins against his country. If it had taken place
eighteen months later, it would have brought
upon him an immediate sentence of death: but
matters not having yet gone so far as they were
destined to proceed, the fact was only recorded
against him.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Let us go,” said Marguerite, faintly, when
she found her husband bent on adhering to his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.48'>48</span>plans, for reasons which she could not gainsay.
“I cannot bear the air of this place.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“We will go presently, love,” replied Charles.
“The first moment that I see you look like yourself,
I will call to Pierre to unlock the door.
Meanwhile, here is a seat; and I will give you
air and something to revive you.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Having seated her where a breath of fresh air
from the little trap-door might blow upon her
face, he brought a flask of rich wine, in a full
glass of which he pledged her, assuring her, with
a smile, that it did not yet taste of gunpowder.
His pledge was,—</p>

<p class='c001'>“Marguerite, my wife,—life and safety to
ourselves and our household! If not these,—at
least the peace of our enlightened and steadfast
will!—Will you not pledge me?”</p>

<p class='c001'>She bowed her head upon his shoulder, and
wept her shame at being unworthy of him,—unfit
to live in such times.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Then preserve yourself, love, to live in better
times. They will come; they must come; and
steady hopefulness will be our best security till
they arrive.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Marguerite so far succeeded in her endeavour
to adopt her husband’s principle, that she returned
with a smile the searching gaze which Pierre
fixed upon her as she issued from the cellar:
but her countenance fell at the first words with
which he answered her intimation that she now
knew the great secret, and would guard it carefully.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_3.49'>49</span>“Alas! Madame. I fear it has ceased to be
a secret——That is,” he added, changing his
tone when he perceived her alarm,—“our men
yonder cannot but observe how carefully we
keep the place locked, and how many customers
we send away; and nothing escapes suspicion in
these times. But your having been down is a
happy circumstance, Madame; especially as you
emerge with an air so charmingly serene.”</p>

<p class='c001'>This hint to look composed was not lost upon
the lady, who tripped across the court with a demeanour
of assumed gaiety. It presently vanished;
and she looked with astonishment on
her husband when at play with the children after
dinner. It rent her heart to hear her father inquire
perpetually how early in the spring they should
set out for Guienne, that he might delight himself
in his beloved olive-groves once more, with the
children by his side: but Charles answered as if
there had still been olive-groves; and as if the
family were at liberty to go whither they pleased
in their beautiful country. When, at intervals,
she saw him whipping his little girl’s wooden
horse, and practising battledore with his young
son, laughing all the while as merrily as either,
she could scarcely believe him to be the same
who had so lately solemnly pledged her over a
train of gunpowder laid by his own resolute
hands.</p>

</div>

<p class='c017'>M. Raucourt had abundance of leisure to repeat
his question about journeying southwards, and to
describe to his grandchildren the wealth of fruit-grounds
that they would inherit from him.
Month after month, as the days grew longer,
and the weather became hotter, he told them
that, when spring came, they should go with
him to groves where pink blossoms came out
before the green leaves, and where the young
oranges grew more golden amidst the verdure as
the season drew on.</p>

<p class='c001'>“But, grandpapa,” objected Julien, “the
spring is going away very fast already.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ah! well, then, we shall be too late for the
almond blossoms, but the oranges and the
grapes will be all the more beautiful.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But,” observed Pauline, when two more
months had passed away, “the vintage will be all
over now before we can get there, mamma says.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, my dear, but there is a spring every
year, and I am talking of next spring.”</p>

<p class='c001'>And so the matter was settled for this year.
Marguerite began to hope that the affair of the
cellars would be so likewise, as Charles had of
late been less importuned to sell, and there had
been no fresh evidences, amidst the increasing
discontents of the people, that he was held in
suspicion. There was even a hope of removing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.51'>51</span>a large part of his stock openly and safely.
Steele wanted more wine, and Antoine, having
none left at Bordeaux, referred him to his
brother; and the Englishman arrived in Paris
to see whether he could enter into another negociation
with the house with which he had
already dealt so extensively. He took up his
abode in Charles’s house, and consulted with
him, and also with some of the authorities of the
city, as to the best mode of removing his purchases,
without exciting the rage of the mob,
who by this time had taken upon themselves to
decide the right and wrong of all matters that
passed before their eyes, whether of the nature
of public or private business. The magistrates,
who politicly adopted the tone of the people as
often as they could, sighed over the anomaly of a
foreigner purchasing wine in Paris, while there
was too little left for Frenchmen; and Steele
wondered as emphatically at the state of affairs
which obliged two merchants to call in the interference
of the magistracy to repel that of the
mob, while they settled their private bargains.
Marguerite thought little of the one anomaly or
the other, in her strong wish to have her husband’s
cellars emptied at all events. The greatest happiness
she could imagine was that of helping
him and Pierre to sweep away the gunpowder,
and throw open the doors of the vacant place to
any one who chose to enter. There was much
to be done, however, before they could arrive at
this fortunate issue.</p>

<p class='c001'>One day, while Steele’s business was pending,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.52'>52</span>a carriage drove up to the door, with considerable
state, and the Marquis de Thou, having
ascertained that the wine-merchant was at home,
alighted, and requested to speak with him on
business. While Charles waited on him, Marguerite
anxiously inquired of Steele respecting
the marquis’s politics; for she apprehended a
snare in every transaction. She thought it
strange that so stout an old royalist should have
any dealings with her husband, and was not
comforted by what she learned from Steele;
namely, that being forced by the hatred of his
country neighbours to leave his chateau in Guienne,
and take refuge in Paris in the middle of summer,
he seemed disposed to trim between the two
parties, and was therefore likely to be a dangerous
person to have dealings with. Immediately on
his arrival, he had contrived to place his daughter
in the queen’s train, while he kept upon terms
with the duke of Orleans. Pleading to himself,
and bidding lady Alice plead to the queen, if
called upon, his old companionship with Orleans,
he did much of the duke’s dirty work, very
unconsciously, very complacently, and with the
comfortable conviction that his loyalty remained
unblemished, while he attended no public meetings,
and managed to be within the palace walls
whenever a popular movement was likely to take
place. While Steele was explaining what was
reported of the marquis at Bordeaux, Charles
appeared.</p>

<p class='c001'>“The marquis wants to make large purchases
of wine,” he said. “Do you conceive he can
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.53'>53</span>have occasion for a fourth part of my stock for
his own use?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“His chateau is shut up,” replied Steele;
“and he is not occupying his hotel in Paris.
Depend upon it, he is shopping for Orleans, as
usual.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“He shall not have enough to intoxicate a
single bravo with,” cried Charles. “Come with
me, Steele, and find some objection to every
sample. Claim as much as you please, and
disgust him with as much more as you can.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Pierre was called in to help, and among the
three, all as solemn as himself, the marquis was
more eminently bamboozled than he had ever been
before in his life; which is saying a great deal.
He protested every sample to be better than the
last, whatever might have been mixed with it by
Pierre in the fetching. He made half a hundred
low bows when Steele claimed all that was tolerable;
and declared his admiration of Charles’s
magnanimity in pointing out the defects of his
own commodity. The civility of M. Pierre also
in vowing that the marquis should have no wine
but the best, which was all, unhappily, sold
already, was worthy of much acknowledgment.
Being under promise, however, to purchase such
and such quantities of wine, he must waive their
polite scruples, and obviate all others by referring
M. Charles Luyon to the most wealthy nobleman
in the kingdom for payment. This avowal
decided the matter. Charles shirked the marquis
all the more speedily for his having owned
that he came from the Duke of Orleans, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.54'>54</span>carriage conveyed away the messenger without
his errand.</p>

<p class='c001'>From day to day other customers came: but,
as all might be traced as instruments of the duke,
they were all dismissed in the same way as the
marquis. Charles was convinced that some popular
commotion was at hand. He perceived that
the truly patriotic movers in the revolution were
more and more hated by Orleans, as his purposes
degenerated more and more from the purity of
theirs; and he could not restrain his indignation
at the efforts that were made to infatuate and
brutalize the people, that they might disgrace
or interrupt the measures of the enlightened of
their leaders, and bring down a nation worthy of
freedom to bow the knee to one who nourished
the passions of a tyrant in the coward heart of a
slave. “He shall not madden the people with
my wine. Whatever they do shall be done in a
state of sanity, as far as I can contribute thereto,”
was still Charles’s resolution; and he declined
prices on which the hand of many a brother in
trade would have closed without a question. He
had too humble an idea of his own consequence
to adopt his wife’s opinion that it was designed
to attach him to the Orleans party by making
him the creditor of its chief. She was confirmed
in her notion, however, by a very disagreeable
circumstance,—the appearance of Orleans himself;—to
purchase fruit, as he declared.</p>

<p class='c001'>From fruit the negociation presently turned to
wine, as Charles expected; and for which he
had prepared himself with a somewhat desperate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.55'>55</span>intent. Knowing the faint heart which his new
customer hid under his impudent address, he
thought he might calculate on the effect which
would be produced by a sight of his underground
preparations; and he accordingly requested his
Grace, with a compliment to his well-known
condescension, to enter the cellar. As soon as
they were fairly in, he called to Pierre to be very
careful of the lantern, as a single spark might be
fatal; invited the duke, unless he objected to
approach so near to the magazine, to inspect the
date of a certain curious old wine; begged to
go first among the fireworks for fear of an accidental
explosion, and so forth; expatiating <span lang="it"><i>con
amore</i></span> on his commodity, in the intervals.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Bless my soul, M. Luyon!” cried the duke,
“what can you mean by making a fortress of
your cellars? It is dangerous to set foot in
them, by your own account.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Only to those who have no business here,”
replied Charles. “My man and I can tread in
security.”</p>

<p class='c001'>And he coolly gave his reasons for rendering
his wine inaccessible; pointing out no party, but
merely with a reference to the perpetual danger
of disturbance in the present times.</p>

<p class='c001'>“But it is absolutely a fortress,” repeated the
duke. “Your door is massive. Is there no
way of escape?——I mean, no other entrance?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“None whatever,” replied Charles; and at
this moment, Pierre, having set down the lantern,
slammed the plated door, and barred and crossbarred
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.56'>56</span>it with a diligence which the guest by no
means approved.</p>

<p class='c001'>“A fortress is perfectly harmless when in
friendly hands, and unless attacked,” observed
Charles. “Here are no weapons of offence,
you observe; and it is far from being my interest
to blow up my stock, unless driven to it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Or even then,” argued the duke. “Supposing
your premises were attacked,—an idle
anticipation;—but supposing they were, it would
answer better to you to have them stripped than
destroyed.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“To my pocket, doubtless,” answered Charles,
occupying himself with opening a flask; “but
not to my conscience. If by my means a mob,
or any individual of a mob, were to be incited to
party violence,—if I were so treacherous as to
allow their impulses of patriotism to be corrupted
into licentiousness,—I should feel the manliness
within me melting away. I should start at
shadows for the rest of my days. No, sir;
perish my possessions, rather than they should
go to corrupt public virtue.—Taste this, I advise
you, my lord duke.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Do not you think the air rather close here?”
asked Orleans, in his smoothest manner. “Are
not the fumes of this wine——”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And of the gunpowder, my lord? They
are no doubt oppressive to those who are unused
to them. Open the door, Pierre.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The duke found his faculty of taste more to
be relied upon in the open air; and took his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.57'>57</span>stand accordingly in the portal, where he stood
negociating and gossiping for an unconscionable
time, till first one or two people appeared in the
court, then more, and more still, and in an
instant the well-known drum was heard close by,
and the shouts of a rabble which poured in without
the slightest warning. Orleans looked as if
he was going to be very angry; but Charles had
no time to parley with his hypocrisy.</p>

<p class='c001'>It was too late to fasten the portal on the outside,
and run to the house. Pierre’s motion was
to pull the duke with them into the cellar; but
his master forbade. He thrust Orleans out of
the portal, calling out,</p>

<p class='c001'>“See, we carry a light in with us; and remember
you tread on hollow ground,”—and
retreated, not allowing even his faithful Pierre to
enter the place of danger with him. He locked,
bolted, barred and double barred the door, went
and placed the lantern close by the train, looked
to his matches and tinder, and then sat down,
with folded arms, to await the issue of the expected
siege. He was fully resolved to sacrifice
his life and property rather than be aiding and
abetting with Orleans in giving a licentious
character to the great act (whatever it might be)
which the people were evidently contemplating.
The more he had thought of the events of the
preceding day, when arms had been seized and
cannon laid hold of by the people, the more
convinced he had been that the present would
not pass away without being signalized by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.58'>58</span>some extraordinary deed, and the more resolutely
determined he felt to use such power as
he had, for the safety and honour of the state.
The fierce yells of the mob outside had no
effect but to increase his courage, as they
served to justify his object to himself; and as he
looked through the dim vault, from the further
end of which came the dull echo of the blows upon
the door, as he observed that the one feeble light
did not so much as flicker in the socket while all
was tumult outside, he felt a thrilling consciousness
of power which was not gloomy, though it
was fearful, and might involve his own destruction.
Whether it would involve any other life,
he had considered much and long; he believed
not; or that if one or a few should be injured
by the slight explosion which would effect his
purpose, this would be a less evil than would be
perpetrated by a drunken mob in possession of
such means of destruction as they had seized the
day before.</p>

<p class='c001'>One circumstance nearly unnerved him. He
had prevented Pierre from entering with him,
under the idea of saving his life from the peril in
which his own was placed; but the sudden outcry
which presently arose, the oaths evidently
directed at an individual, the cries of shrill
female voices,—“To the lamp-post with him!”—agonized
Charles with the idea that the vengeance
of the mob for his opposition was to fall
upon his unfortunate servant. He felt a momentary
impulse to throw open the door and take
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.59'>59</span>all the consequences, the first of which would
undoubtedly be that he would be taken to the
lamp-post,——</p>

<p class='c001'>“Not instead of Pierre, but with him,” he
thought, however, in another moment. “No. I
cannot save him; so I will persevere. And may
heaven hold me guiltless of his blood; for I meant
well towards him!—But what now?—What a
silence!—Have they sent for fire to smoke me
out? I will throw up a thicker smoke presently,
if that be it.—O, what a horrible cry! What
can have put them in a new rage?”</p>

<p class='c001'>If Charles could have looked through the
thick walls of his vault, he would have seen that
which might well have called down an immediate
sentence of death on all his household; that
which added new horrors to his wife’s suspense,
and increased the agony of poor Pierre, standing
as he was in the grasp of two of the enemy, and
assured by the fish-women about him that he
was to be hanged as soon as they could find a
cord. He forgot his own situation for a moment
when he looked up to the balcony, and saw the
deplorable mistake which was likely to prove the
destruction of the whole family. Nobody within
doors had thought of M. Raucourt, whom
no event was now ever known to bring from his
easy chair at the front window. He was left
alone while the back of the house was being
barricaded with all speed, and messengers put
out upon the roof to find their way, if possible,
to the authorities; or at least to make signals
for assistance. But the children came in a state
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.60'>60</span>of amazement to grandpapa, and the shouts
reached even his dull ear, and recalled the associations
which in the old royalist were always
the first to be awakened. He had no other idea
than that the people were hailing the royal family,
and he resolved not to be behind others in his
duty. He sent Pauline for the white cockade
he had given her, tottered to his chamber, got out,
under a new impulse of strength, upon the balcony,
and waved his white favour. It was this
which had silenced the mob with astonishment;
and in the depth of this silence, the feeble,
cracked voice of the old man was heard trying
to shout “Vive le Roi!”</p>

<p class='c001'>The horrible burst of passion which followed
was not directed against him. The helplessness
of his attitude as he stood supporting himself
with both hands, and the gleam of foolish pleasure
which came over his countenance, showed
his real state; and even the lowest of the mob
did not yet make war against dotards. It was
because his act was supposed to betoken the
politics of the family that it excited such an outcry;
and there seemed some reason for Pierre’s
fears that the very house would be presently
levelled with the ground. It made his heart
sick within him to see the old man smiling and
bowing, and trying to induce the shrinking
children to come and stand beside him, and resisting
his wretched daughter’s attempts to withdraw
him. Pierre struggled fiercely, but in
vain; he implored, more humbly than he would
have stooped to do for his own life, to be allowed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.61'>61</span>two minutes’ speech to the people. He met
only threats and laughter. The threats mattered
little to a man who expected to be hanged in a
few minutes, but the laughter stung him to the
soul. He cursed himself for the folly of having
appealed to those who could mock the innocence
of dotage and childhood, and disregard the agony
of a woman: and he recalled the words in which
he had at first spoken to them as the French
people.</p>

<p class='c001'>Pierre was right. These were no sample of
the French people who had begun to cast off the
yoke of tyranny. These were a portion of the
brutalized class who, in using the word tyranny,
thought only of the difference between suffering
and inflicting it: who, when they talked of
liberty, asked for license to plunder palaces and
riot in wine-cellars. These were, in short, the
Orleans mob, and not the real authors of the
political changes now taking place. They aided
these changes at the time, indeed, by testifying
to the degree of oppression which the lower
orders had till now suffered; and they furnish,
to this day and for ever, an instructive commentary
upon these changes, in as far as they
exhibit the operation of despotism in preparing
its own downfall by at once brutalizing and exasperating
its victims. But still these were perfectly
distinct from the true protectors of liberty,
the wise and steady opponents of despotism.
These last were very differently employed this
morning, and tidings of their doings came just
in time to preserve Charles and his family.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_3.62'>62</span>The children had already been sent away
by the roof, in charge of the servants, and
Marguerite had sat down alone beside the
chair of her father, (whom it was impossible
to remove, and whom she would not leave,)
when sounds reached her which gave her back
a little of the hope she had wholly surrendered.
It was not the approach of soldiers, nor the
potential voices of magistrates, nor any of the
welcome intimations of help at hand which conclude
a riot and disperse a rabble in an orderly
country, and under ordinary circumstances.
Neither soldiers nor magistrates could be depended
upon, or had any power in Paris at this
time but that which the outrageous mob chose
to allow them. Marguerite knew this so well,
that, though she took all precautions in sending
for aid, she expected none but that which might
arise from accident. Such a diversion of the
people’s rage as actually happened was beyond
her hopes.</p>

<p class='c001'>While her father was still talking about the
king, and she was holding him down in his chair,
in opposition to his complaints of not being
allowed to go to the window to pay his duty, the
fearful sound of the tocsin was heard above all
the uproar in the court and street. One cry
seemed to come on the four winds,—“To the
Bastille! to the Bastille!” At first confused
and reiterated, the clangor and the shout echoed
noisily from street to street, from steeple to
steeple. Presently the cry became more concentrated,
as if the city sent up but one mighty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.63'>63</span>voice. Marguerite sank down on her knees,
overcome with the hope of deliverance for her
husband; but the mob did not yet cease to batter
the door which shielded him, and the fierce
women cried out that they would not be decoyed
away by a false alarm. After a few more moments
came the booming of cannon on the ear,
and a pause followed in the court. Again it
came, and again, and the windows rattled, and
there was in the intervals quiet enough for the
rushing of a steady stream of people to be heard
from the streets, from whom arose, in alternation
with silence, the deep and steady cry, “To the
Bastille!” The mob in the court mixed with
this stream, eager to learn what new scene was
to be enacted, what better hope of plunder was
presented than that afforded by the stores of an
obstinate and insignificant wine-merchant, who
had already caused them more trouble than he
and his goods were worth. They looked round
for a signal from their leader, but Orleans had
disappeared some time before, not choosing to
be held responsible for the violence to which he
had tempted his followers. They went to look
for him at the Bastille, where he was indeed present,
to help, as usual, to disgrace a work set
on foot by better men.</p>

<p class='c001'>As soon as the court was empty, Marguerite
flew to release her husband. Charles was
listening intently to ascertain whether this hush
was a treacherous calm, or whether he was indeed
safe for the present, when he felt a breath
of fresh air, and saw a glimmer of daylight fall
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.64'>64</span>into the midst of the vault, and heard a faint
voice calling to him,—</p>

<p class='c001'>“Come out, love! If you are safe, all is
safe.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Not all, Charles remembered, when he had
time to think of any one but his wife. Before
he even went to seek his children, and to <a id='corr64.7'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='recal'>recall</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_64.7'><ins class='correction'>recall</ins></a></span>
the servants, he ascertained that Pierre had disappeared,
and hurried out to learn his fate, bending
his steps to the Place de Grêve, where he
feared he was most likely to find his faithful servant,
dead or alive. He found two bodies hanging,
and cries of murderous exultation, which
made his blood run cold, still echoing through
the place; but Pierre was nowhere to be seen,
and the bodies were those of soldiers. He saw
more victims brought to the foot of the lamp-posts;
but they came from the direction of the
Bastille, and were evidently members of the
invalid garrison. Through some unseen influence
exerted in the crowd, these men were
spared, which gave Charles the hope that Pierre,
if yet living, would escape. In fact, he was safe
enough, being at this moment employed in
drawing the people to the attack upon that
gloomy fortress, which was regarded with more
detestation by Frenchmen than if it had been a
pest-house. When Pierre had by his energy
sufficiently attested his good citizenship to be
allowed to depart whither he would, he ran
homewards, met his master in search of him,
embraced the children, kissed Marguerite’s hand,
and hastened back again to assist the siege, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.65'>65</span>if nothing had happened to himself that morning.
Charles did the same, having persuaded his wife
that he should be safer before the Bastille than
at home, and left her in the protection of Steele,
who had returned from his fruitless errand to
the magistrates; fruitless, because they could
listen to no petitions for private succour while
the grand work of the demolition of the state-fortress
was going on under their sanction, and
the control of their forces.</p>

<p class='c001'>Steele had no more idea of remaining with
the women and children on such an occasion,
than his friend Charles. As soon as he had
persuaded Marguerite to lie down, and had seen
grandpapa and the children at play together
again, and called in two stout porters of the
establishment to keep watch below, he also disappeared.
Often and vehemently did he protest
in after years that he would not for any consideration
have been absent from that siege;
and of all his possessions, none were so valued
by him as a link of the chain from which one of
the captives had been released by Steele’s own
hands; which link the Englishman carried about
him to the day of his death.</p>

<p class='c001'>While Marguerite slept, through pure exhaustion,
occasionally starting at the sound of cannon,
or scared with visions of the horrible faces she
had seen in the court so lately, her husband was
actively disproving, to as many as might observe
him, his being a royalist. He lent a helping
hand to one work after another; now assisting
in letting down the drawbridges successively;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.66'>66</span>now in hauling forward the cannon; now in
demolishing the guard-houses; now in forcing
an entrance into the gloomy place itself; and
finally, shouting for the release of the prisoners.
Everything was forgotten but the work before
his eyes: hours flew like minutes, amidst the
intenseness of the occupation; and yet, if his
thoughts reverted for a moment to the events of
the morning, they seemed of ancient date,—as
if he had lived a lifetime in this one day.</p>

<p class='c001'>The spectacles of a lifetime were indeed to be
beheld within the compass of this one scene.
The most vivid emotions to which all ranks and
all ages are subject were here in full play: all
the various grouping which life affords was
here presented; the entire elements of the
scenery of human character were here congregated
in infinite and magnificent combinations.
The appeals to eye and ear alone were of unprecedented
force; those addressed to the spirit
equalled in stimulus the devotion of Leonidas
in his defile, and excelled in pathos the meditation
of Marius among more extensive ruins than
those which were now tumbling around. From
the heights of the fortress might be seen a
heaving ocean of upturned faces, when the breeze
dispersed at intervals the clouds of smoke which
veiled the sun, and gave a dun and murky hue to
whatever lay beneath. If a flood of sunshine
now and then poured in to make a hundred thousand
weapons glitter over the heads of the
crowd, the black row of cannon belched forth
their red fires to extinguish the purer light.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.67'>67</span>The foremost of the people, with glaring eyes,
and blackened and grinning faces, looked
scarcely human, in their excess of eagerness,
activity, and strength. Yet more terrific were
the sounds: the clang of the tocsin at regular
intervals, the shouts of the besiegers, the shrieks
of the wounded, the roar of the fire which was
consuming the guard-houses, the crash of the
ruins falling on all sides, a heavy splash in the
moat from time to time, as some one was toppled
from the ramparts to be smothered in its mud,—and
above all these, the triumphant cries of
victory and liberty achieved,—these were enough
to dizzy weak brains, and give inspiration to
strong ones. Here were also the terrors which
sooner or later chill the marrow of despotism,
and the stern joy with which its retribution fires
the heart of the patriot. Here were the servants
of tyranny quailing before the glance of the
people; kneeling soldiers craving mercy of
mechanics, of women, of some of every class
whom, in the execution of their fancied duty,
they had outraged. Here were men shrinking
from violence with a craven horror, and women
driven by a sense of wrong to show how disgusting
physical courage may be made. Here were
also sons led on to the attack by their hitherto
anxious fathers; husbands thrust forward into
danger by their wives; and little children upreared
by their mothers amidst the fire and
smoke, to take one last look of the hated edifice
which was soon to be levelled with the ground.
The towers of palaces might be seen afar, where
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.68'>68</span>princes were quaking at this final assurance of
the <a id='corr68.2'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='downfal'>downfall</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_68.2'><ins class='correction'>downfall</ins></a></span> of their despotic sway, knowing that
the assumed sanctity of royalty was being wafted
away with every puff of smoke which spread
itself over the sky, and their irresponsibility
melting in fires lighted by the hands which they
had vainly attempted to fetter, and blown by the
breath which they had imagined they could stifle.
They had denied the birth of that liberty whose
baptism in fire and in blood was now being
celebrated in a many-voiced chaunt with which
the earth should ring for centuries. Some from
other lands were already present to hear and
join in it; some free Britons to aid, some
wondering slaves of other despots to slink homewards
with whispered tidings of its import; for
from that day to this, the history of the fall of
the Bastille has been told as a secret in the vineyards
of Portugal, and among the groves of
Spain, and in the patriotic conclaves of the
youth of Italy, while it has been loudly and joyfully
proclaimed from one end to the other of
Great Britain, till her lisping children are
familiar with the tale.</p>

<p class='c001'>The congregation would not have been complete
without the presence of another class of
witnesses whose very existence will perhaps be
matter of incredulity in some future age of the
world;—that class which man has taken upon
himself to institute, and which will one day rise
up against him in judgment of his abused power.
There were captives present in this scene of
lawless freedom,—or rather of freedom above
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.69'>69</span>the law. They were there, first trembling before
the assailants, and then marvelling at the treatment
they received, as the kid would marvel at
being dandled by the lion. So it appeared to
be with most of them, while one or two caught
the tone of popular triumph before the doors of
their cells were opened, and others received their
deliverance in a manner that rent the heart of
the deliverers.</p>

<p class='c001'>When the capture of the place was complete,
and its defenders had been carried off, some to
be sacrificed for the sins of the government, and
others to meet with mercy, Charles pressed forward,
with a multitude of companions, to release
the captives. It was hard labour to pull the
clenched doors from their staples and hinges;
and in some cases it was found easier to effect
the work in a yet more irregular manner: as in
one to which Steele called Charles’s attention
when they accidentally met in the centre of the
fortress, where the light of day, however, streamed
upon them through the demolished roof. Steele’s
face was working in strong emotion, and he
appeared speechless while he seized his friend by
the arm, and drew him to gaze on what made
his heart’s blood boil. Steele pointed through
a breach in the enormous wall, whose thickness
shut out all sound from the inmate of the dungeon
it inclosed; and there, with eyes drooped
before the unwonted light,—a light which, however,
only half displayed the squalid sickliness of
his countenance, sat one who seemed to take no
heed of any human presence. His expanded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.70'>70</span>nostrils and half-opened mouth seemed to betoken
that there had been passion and expectation
within him; but the apathy and despondency
of his attitude exhibited a strange contradiction
to these evidences. When the first face appeared
through the opening, he fumbled uneasily with his
hands in his coarse dungeon dress; and when he was
hailed, more and more loudly, under the idea that
he was deaf, his beard was seen to stir upon his
breast, and his lips to move, as if he was attempting
in vain to articulate a sound. The endeavour
presently ceased, though voice after voice was
heard in importunity,—sometimes endearing,
sometimes rallying,—that he would rise and help
to free himself. It was a work of time to make
a breach large enough to admit his deliverers;
and at last, just before the first of them clambered
in, the captive uplifted his broken and
unmodulated voice in a few words, one or two
of which Steele recognized to be English.</p>

<p class='c001'>“O! he is a Briton!” cried he, clenching
his hands above his head in the extremity of
passion; and, staggering against the wall, he
uttered a deep curse on the tyranny by which a
countryman had been goaded into madness far from
his own land, and from all who could know or
avenge his state. Again and again he looked;
again and again he withdrew, unable to bear
the alternating aspects of idiotcy and gibbering
madness. At last, he made trial of a new kind
of stimulus; leaning through the breach, and
calling to the captive,—</p>

<p class='c001'>“O come, and take the hand of a brother
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.71'>71</span>once more! Look up, and tell us that your deliverers
are welcome! Let it be crime, or let it
be misery that has stricken you so deeply, the
last day of your dungeon life is over. Come,
and hear about England! Come and feel the
fresh air——”</p>

<p class='c001'>The prisoner here shivered, as if already
chilled by the air of a warm July day. Encouraged
by this sign of attention, Steele went on.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Only tell us whom you fear, and we will
carry you far from them. Only name those you
love, and I will get you tidings of them. Come
and help us to free yourself and others; for you
know more of the secrets of this horrible place
than we.”</p>

<p class='c001'>He would not move, however; and when they
got to him, they found that he was chained by
the middle to the wall behind him. It was impossible
to learn from him his name, alleged
offence, or period of imprisonment.</p>

<p class='c001'>It was not till the Count de Solages was also
liberated that it was ascertained that his name
was White; that he had been confined for some
unknown offence for many years in the castle of
Vincennes, whence he was removed, in company
with the count, to the Bastille, seven years
before.</p>

</div>

<p class='c017'>The people carried away all the prisoners on
their shoulders, intending to make them tell their
stories in the coffee-houses of Paris; but Steele
could not bear to see his countryman,—such a
mere wreck of humanity as he was,—thus exhibited.
He thankfully accepted his friend Charles’s
invitation to bring him first to his house, and
try whether the intellects of the sufferer could
be restored by any method of treatment—treatment
which was more likely to be efficacious if
administered by one who could speak his own
language than by strangers. Fired as Steele
had been in the achievement of the great work
of the day, he now left the completion of it to
others. While the mayor and executive were
sending forth their popular decrees,—while the
king was informed for the first time that his
realm was in a state of revolution,—while the
helpless ministry looked in one another’s dismayed
faces,—while the city architects were
employed under a regular commission to make a
perfect blank where the Bastille had stood,
Steele was watching over his released countryman,
fondly hoping that he traced an hourly
growing resemblance to manhood, not only in
external appearance, but in thought and action.
He tried to make him vary his posture, and to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.73'>73</span>walk;—an exercise to which he was as much
averse as one who has taken laudanum. The
next thing was to induce him to speak, which
proved less difficult, provided he was permitted
to mix up French and English after his own
fashion. There was sometimes more and sometimes
less sense in what he said, and it was occasionally
interrupted by fits of impotent passion,
for which no immediate cause could be assigned.
These, however, came on only after his new
way of life had continued for some time, and
were indeed stages in the growth of the unmanageable
madness which sent him, after all remedial
means had been tried, to end his days in
the lunatic asylum at Charenton.</p>

<p class='c001'>Before these had become terrifying to Charles’s
children, they did not shrink from talking to
him, and were encouraged to do so, as he spoke
more, and more sensibly to them than to any
one else.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Why are you so very fond of water, I wonder?”
exclaimed Julien, one day, laughing,
when White held out his hand to snatch some
which looked cool and clear in the boy’s hand.
“O yes, you may have it. I can get plenty
more. Why do you want so much water?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I drink water. And my rat—Where is my
rat?”</p>

<p class='c001'>None of the family could make out why he
looked about him for a rat: but Steele’s conjecture
was that such an animal might have found
its way out of the moat of the prison into the
cell where no other living thing could enter but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.74'>74</span>the silent turnkey. On inquiry, this was found
to be the case; and the circumstances were
touching in the extreme to those who had never
known what it was to want such a resource. It
was observed that White was as greedy of bread
as of water, though not always for the purpose
of eating it. Nothing could tempt him from it
when there was any in the room; and whatever
was offered in exchange for a crust, however
delicate to the taste, or glittering to the eye, was
rejected. “Bread, bread. Water, water,” was
for ever his cry.</p>

<p class='c001'>“He likes to play on my bird-organ,” observed
Julien, “and I told him he might keep
it: but he thrust it back upon me for a piece of
bread. He sold it much cheaper, papa,—for far
less bread,—than the people that made it. I
think that is very silly.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It depends upon the value he puts upon
what he has in exchange,” answered papa.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, you told me how much bread was
worth this organ; and it was much more than I
gave him.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes; but you might happen to be shut up,
as he has been, where one loaf of bread would
be more useful to you than ten such at home.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Why more useful? I can but eat bread
anywhere.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes; you can give it away,” interposed
mamma. “If you were shut up for several years
in a silent and nearly dark place, where nobody
ever came to you, and were to hear a noise
one day, and to see something moving, and to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.75'>75</span>find out that it was a rat which had made its
way to your cell; and if you wished that the
rat should come again, and learn to know you,
and feed tamely out of your hand, would you
not desire to have some food to give it?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“O yes: I would give it part of my dinner.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But if you had very little dinner, scarcely
enough to satisfy your own hunger, you would
buy more bread for your rat if you could. If
your jailer asked you much more than the bread
would be worth out of prison, you would give it
him rather than your rat should not come and
play with you. You would pay him first all
your copper, and then all your silver, and then
all your gold.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes, because I could not play with money
so pleasantly as with a live animal, and there
would be nothing else that I could buy in such
a place. I had rather have the company of my
rat than a pocket full of gold.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“So White thought,” observed Marguerite,
“and he gave the turnkey every thing he had
left for bread, till his buttons, and his pencil
case, and even his watch were all gone. It was
a long time before he could bring himself to
part with his watch; for the moving of the
wheels was something to look at, and the ticking
kept his ears awake, and made him feel less
desolate: but when it came to giving up his
watch or his rat, he thought he could least spare
his live companion: so he carefully observed
for some time the shifting of the glimmering
light upon the wall, as the morning passed into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.76'>76</span>noon, and noon into afternoon and evening, and
then he thought this sort of dial might serve
him instead of a watch, and he gave it to the
turnkey on condition of having an ounce more
bread every day for a year.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“He must have been pleased to have made
his bargain for a whole year.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“His pleasure lasted a very short while. The
turnkey came earlier than usual one day when
the rat was there, and twisted its neck before
White could stop him.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Julien stamped with grief and anger when he
heard this; but presently supposed the turnkey
was honest enough to restore the watch. Charles
shook his head in answer, and told his little son
that poor White had been quite crazy since that
day, and had talked about nothing but a rat, and
shown no desire for any thing but bread and
water since, though it was six years ago that his
misfortune had happened.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Did you ever hear of paying for water,
Julien; or for air?”</p>

<p class='c001'>No: Julien thought that God had given both
so freely that it would be a sin to sell them. His
father thought this not a good reason; for it
seemed to him fair that men should buy and
sell whenever one wanted something that another
person had too much of; as much air and water
as corn and flax, which were also given by God.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ah, but, papa, it costs men a great deal of
trouble to prepare corn and flax.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“True; and now you have hit upon the right
reason. If corn and flax grew of themselves on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.77'>77</span>land which belonged to nobody, would you pay
for them, or just gather them without paying?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I should be very silly to pay when I might
have them without.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“So I think: but would corn and flax be less
valuable then than now, when we have to pay
very dear for them?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“The corn would be just as good to eat, and
the flax to make linen of: but they would not
to change away.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“No more than the air, which is very useful
in breathing, or water which we could not do
without, and which yet would be a very poor
thing to carry to market. Now, would you call
water a valuable thing or not, Julien?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“No, not at all, because it will buy nothing——O
yes, but it is though; because we could
not do without it.—Mamma, is water valuable
or not?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Very valuable in use, but not usually in exchange.
When things are valuable in exchange,
it is either because they cost labour before they
could be used, or because they are very scarce.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“So,” observed Charles, “if a mine should
ever be dug so deep that the air is not fresh at
the bottom where the miners work, the owner of
the mine would be very glad to buy air of any
one who could convey it down by a machine.
Such an one would be wise to charge so much a
gallon for the fresh air he supplied, to pay for
the labour and expense of his machine, and for
the trouble of working it.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_3.78'>78</span>Marguerite then mentioned that she once staid
in a small country town during a drought.
There was no reservoir of water, and all the
pumps and cisterns were dry. The poor people
went out by night into the neighbouring country,
and watched the springs; and any one who was
fortunate enough to obtain a gallon of fresh
water was well paid for it. The price rose every
day, till at last one woman gave a calf for a pailfull
of water, hoping to save her cow, it being
certain that both must die without this supply.</p>

<p class='c001'>“And did she save her cow?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes. While the woman was anxiously
sitting up in bed, planning what she should
change away next, she fancied there was a different
feel in the air; and on looking out of the
window, she found the sky covered with black
clouds; and before morning, the trade in water
was over. There was nobody to give a doit for
a cistern-full.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It was just so with me,” observed Charles,
“when I was besieged in the cellar. I was
parched with thirst, and would have given a
pipe of my best wine to any one who would have
let me down a quart of water through the trap-door.
Three hours after, I myself threw hundreds
of gallons on the fire at the guard houses,
when the order was given to take them down in
an orderly way; and I did not consider such use
of the water any waste. So much for the value
which is given by scarcity.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But, papa, though things are more valuable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.79'>79</span>to people when there is a scarcity of them, the
people are less rich than they were before. That
seems to me very odd.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Because you have been accustomed to consider
value and wealth as the same things, which
they are not. Our wealth consists in whatever
is valuable in use as well as in exchange. Owing
to the storm of last year, I have less wealth
in my possession now than I had then, though
what I have may, perhaps, exchange for more
wealth still. I have as much furniture, and as
many clothes and luxuries, and as much money;
but I have fewer growing vines, and much less
wine. If I were to use up my own grapes and
wine instead of selling them, they would last a
much shorter time than my stock of the former
year would have lasted. So I have less wealth
in possession. But the value of wine has risen
so high, in consequence of scarcity, that I can
get as much now of other things in exchange
for a pint, as I could, fourteen months ago, in
exchange for a gallon.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But that is partly because the wine is older.
Mr. Steele is very particular about the wine
being old, and he pays you much more, he told
me, the longer it has been kept.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And it is very fair he should, for reasons
which you can hardly understand yet.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Try him,” said Marguerite.</p>

<p class='c001'>“It is impossible, my dear. I refer to the
charges I am at for the rent of my cellar, the
wear of my casks, and the loss of interest upon
the capital locked up in the wine. All this must
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.80'>80</span>be paid out of the improvement in the quality
of the article; and all this, Julien must wait a
few years to understand.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Now tell me, my boy, whether you think it a
good thing or not that there should be a scarcity
of wine?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Why, papa, as we do not want to drink all
you have ourselves, and as people will give you
as much for it as they would for twice as much,
I do not think it signifies to you; but it must be
a bad thing for the people of Paris that there is
so little wine to be had. At least you said so
about the bread.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But if my wine should be as dear next year,
and I should have no more losses from storms,
and no more expense than in common years, in
growing my wine, would the high price be a
good thing for me or not?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It would be good for you, and bad for
your customers; only I think they would not
give you so much for your wine. They would
remember that there had been no more storms,
and they would find people that had cheaper
wine to sell, and then they would leave off buying
of you.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And they would be very right, if there was
anybody to sell cheaper; as there <a id='corr80.27'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='wonld'>would</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_80.27'><ins class='correction'>would</ins></a></span> be, if
labourers had less wages, and so made it less
expensive to grow and prepare wine. But if
some way was found of making more wine than
ever, in a cheaper way than ever, who would be
the better for that?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“The people that buy of you, because I suppose
you would let them have it cheaper.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_3.81'>81</span>“And papa too,” said Marguerite, “for many
people would buy wine who cannot afford it
now.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Therefore,” concluded Charles, “a high exchangeable
value is not at all a good thing for
everybody, though it may be for a time to some
few. <a id='corr81.7'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Aud['>And</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_81.7'><ins class='correction'>And</ins></a></span> a low exchangeable value is a very
good thing to everybody, if it arises from the
only cause which can render it permanent,—a
diminution of the cost of production.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But if this happened with every article,”
pursued Marguerite, “there would be an end
of the cheapness, though not of the plenty. As
many of one thing would exchange for a certain
number of other things as before.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“True; but less labour would purchase them
all; and this is the grand consideration. As
less labour will now purchase a deal table than
was once necessary to procure a rough hewn log
in its place, less labour still may hereafter buy a
mahogany one; and this is a desirable thing for
the purchasers of tables, and no less for the
makers, who will then sell a hundred times the
number they can dispose of now.”</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_3.82'>82</span>
  <h3 id='ch3.6' class='c020'><span class='sc'>Chapter VI.</span><br> <br> NEW DEVICES.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c017'>The Parisians soon after showed that they knew
little of the resources on which the supply of the
wants of the state should depend, by having recourse
to a measure which, however popular,
was one of great folly;—folly to be exceeded
only by an act of the populace which took place
nearly at the same time.</p>

<p class='c001'>The coffers of the government had long been
empty. Loans of almost every kind, and under
every species of pretence, had been raised upon the
suffering nation, some of which proved failures
in their primary object, while others, however
great the proceeds in amount, seemed to be
exhausted with somewhat the same speed as
water that is poured into a sieve. Never money
went away so fast before; and whilst the government
was dismayed at its magic property of
disappearance, the people grew more and more
angry at what they thought the extravagance
of their rulers. Neither of them took into the
account the scarcity of most of the necessaries of
life, and both regarded money as having the same
value as ever,—as being, in itself, the thing required
to supply the necessities of the state. To
both it was equally inconceivable why, if so much
had defrayed such and such expenses in former
years, double the sum would go no way at all at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.83'>83</span>present. The ministers and the court could only
tremble at the necessity of owning the truth,
while the people raged, and could be appeased
only by court largesses for the relief of the starving:
which largesses went as little way when they
had changed hands as before. Neither party
suspected that money, although scarce, had become
very cheap through the still greater scarcity
of other things; and in the absence of this necessary
knowledge, everybody was eager about
gold and silver.</p>

<p class='c001'>The National Assembly had tried all means,
first by themselves, and then with the assistance
of Necker, to raise a supply, without which the
affairs of the state could not, they believed, proceed;
and all in vain. Then Necker had leave
given him to pursue his own methods; and,
popular as he was, no one had a doubt that he
would succeed. But he failed, though he issued
the most tempting proposals; offered the highest
interest that ever was heard of, even in such
an emergency; and exerted his utmost personal
influence in favour of the loan. The subscription
was not half filled: the reason of which was that
many had no money, having spent it all in buying
necessaries; and as many in France as had
taken their money (much of it had gone into
other countries) expected to want it themselves
for the same purposes, or had not confidence
enough in the stability of the government to take
it for a creditor. So the king’s horses went on
to eat borrowed hay or to want it; and the
king’s servants to clamour for their wages; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.84'>84</span>the king’s tradesmen to decline orders on one
pretence or another; and the police threatened
to leave the home minister to keep order by himself;
and state couriers went unwillingly forth
on their journies; and business lagged in every
department of the administration.</p>

<p class='c001'>At this moment, it entered some wise head
that, if people would not lend money, they might
lend or give something else; not corn or hay,
or any of the necessaries of life; for every one
knew there was still less of these things than of
money; but gold and silver in any form. It would
have been hard to say what lasting good this could
do amidst the impossibility of procuring the necessaries
of which gold and silver are only the representatives:
but no matter for that. Nobody
was asked to explain the affair, and apparently
none troubled themselves to think about it; so
delighted were all with the new notion of giving
away trinkets to save the state. The idea of a
patriotic contribution was charming,—a contribution
in which almost everybody could join;
women and children, and persons of many degrees
below the class of capitalists. The court
joined: the gentlemen sacrificing nearly half
their watches and seals, and the ladies adopting
simplicity as a fashion, and sending away the
jewellery they could not wear as Arcadian shepherdesses
and Sicilian nymphs. The Assembly followed,
every member thereof stooping down at
the same moment to strip his shoes of their
buckles, so that their act of patriotic devotion
made really a very fine show. This gave the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.85'>85</span>signal to the whole country, and all France was
forthwith unbuckled in respect of the feet. She
became also quakerlike as to the hands, for not a
maiden but took out her lover’s hair from his
parting gift, and flung the ring into the lap of the
nation; not a wife that did not part with the
token of her wifehood in the cause. Pecks of
gold rings, bushels of silver buckles, with huge
store of other baubles, were at once in the possession
of the state; and the people no longer
doubted that all would henceforth be well.</p>

<p class='c001'>And what was really the event?—The gold
answered the same purpose as it does when a
basin full of it coined stands on the banker’s
counter during a run. It satisfied the ignorant
that all must be safe where there is so much
wealth actually before one’s eyes. It hushed the
clamours of the people for a little while; and
made the servants of the government willing to
go on somewhat longer upon credit; so that
more industry and briskness prevailed for a time,
at the risk of ultimate disappointment, and an
aggravation of popular fury,—now diverted but
not dispersed. A mob went about to <em>levy</em> these
<em>voluntary</em> offerings, an act ludicrously inconsistent
with their next proceeding; if, indeed, any
of the events of this extraordinary time could be
regarded as ludicrous.</p>

<p class='c001'>They called at Charles’s house among others,
whence, as it happened, no such offerings had
yet gone forth. Charles had resisted Pauline’s
wish to lend the queen her thimble, and Julien’s
offer to pay his first tax with the silver-tipped
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.86'>86</span>riding-whip grandpapa had given him. Neither
would he allow Marguerite’s few ornaments, all
keepsakes, to be thrown away in any such manner.
He would give the coat off his back to the state,
he said, when it could do any service; but the
proposed gifts could only help to make jewellery
a drug, without supplying one more person with
bread, or lessening by so much as one scruple
the burdens of the state. He was disposed to
be vexed when he came home one day, and found
a short allowance of spoons at the dinner-table,
the clock on the mantel-piece gone, and his wife
as destitute of external ornament as any Arcadian
shepherdess at Versailles. He laughed,
however, at his wife’s apologies for having made
a voluntary offering against her own will as well
as his, and hoped that she would be as little the
worse as the state would be the better for the
sacrifice. Goldsmiths and jewellers of enterprise
and capital would profit by the fancy, he observed,
if nobody else did; and the many losers might
find some comfort in sympathy with the very few
winners.</p>

<p class='c001'>The people, meanwhile, were bitterly complaining
of famine, and the more gold was carried
to the treasury, the more bread was bought up
before the eyes of those who were deprived of it
from its increased price. It mattered not that
some was given away in charity by the king, and
more, to suit his own purposes, by the duke of
Orleans; the people were rendered unable to
purchase it, and furnished with the plea of want,
wherewith to make the streets of Paris echo. It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.87'>87</span>would have been better to have let the exchange
of wedding rings for bread be made without the
interposition of the king or his ministers, even
without taking into consideration the events
which followed. A report was soon industriously
spread that the bread furnished by court charity
was of a bad quality. It was believed, like everything
that was then said against the court; and
the consequence was that an anomalous and melancholy
sight was seen by as many as walked
in the city. Clamorous, starving crowds besieged
the bakers’ shops, and carried off all the
bread from their ovens, all the flour from their
bins; while the discontented among the mob
politicians of the Orleans faction were on the
way to snatch the food from the mouths of the
hungry and throw it into the river, and to cut the
sacks, and mix the flour with the puddles of the
streets. Want and waste, faction and delusion
were here seen in their direct extremes.</p>

<p class='c001'>At this time, Charles and Marguerite did not
allow their children to go out under any guardianship
but that of their father, as it was impossible
to foresee what might happen in the
streets before they could get home again. They
were as safe as any could be at such a time;—safer
than the few who ventured abroad in carriages
at the risk of insult wherever they turned;
safer than the sordidly fed and clad, who were
seized upon by the agents of faction to augment
their mobs, and be made the instruments of violence
under the penalty of suffering it themselves.
The parents and children were also safer together
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.88'>88</span>than separate; as a domestic party,
abroad to take the air, presented as unsuspicious
a group, and one as likely to pass unnoticed, as
could well be imagined. Yet they had their occasional
alarms; and when there was no cause
to fear for themselves, were too often grieved
and shocked at what they beheld inflicted on
others.</p>

<p class='c001'>“O papa!” cried Julien, one day, as they
were walking; “what are they doing at Maigrot’s
shop? I do believe the crowd is coming
there next.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Maigrot was a baker, well known to Charles’s
family, and much beloved by the children, on
account of the little hot cakes which seemed to
be always ready to pop out of the oven and into
their mouths, when they went with the servant
to deliver orders or pay bills.</p>

<p class='c001'>Instead of his usual smiling face, Maigrot was
now seen in a state of desperate anxiety, as well
as could be judged from the glimpse of him at
his door, trying first to slip out, and then to
force his way between the two men who were
evidently placed at the entrance as guards till
the mob should come up. Foiled in his attempt,
Maigrot disappeared, and Charles thought that
it might depend on whether there was a way of
exit at the back of the house, whether his head
would presently be carried on a pike, between
two loaves of his own bread, or whether he would
be kneading and baking in peace ten years hence.
There seemed to be just time to run and give a
word of advice to whomsoever might be waiting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.89'>89</span>in the shop, and Charles ran forward to do so.
He was prevented entering; but seeing Maigrot’s
wife sinking and trembling behind the
counter, and looking absolutely incapable of any
resolution whatever, he called out to her to assist in
emptying the flour bins and distributing the
bread, and to fear nothing, and all would be well.
The woman tossed off a glass of water which
stood beside her, and rallied for the effort. In
such effort lay the only resource of sufferers
under violence in those days; for the magistracy
were unable to afford assistance; or, if able,
were not to be depended on. The shop was
presently emptied and gutted, and its stock carried
away, without, however, being in this instance
preceded by the horrible display of a human
head. Maigrot had escaped and actually joined
in with the mob in time to see his own flour cast
into the Seine. Nobody thought more of the baker,
and he took advantage of this disregard to learn
a great deal of his own doings which he did not
know before. He now overheard that his flour
was mixed with hurtful ingredients by order of
his customer, the king; that an inferior kind
was sold at high prices as the best; and that
there were stores of meal concealed somewhere
about his premises, to victual the soldiers who
were to be brought to rule the city, and give the
king his own way. All this was news to Maigrot,
who was compelled to listen to these falsehoods
in silence: more fortunate than many who
had lost their lives as well as their good name
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.90'>90</span>under similar charges. A defender sprang up,
however, when he least expected it.</p>

<p class='c001'>Charles and his little son could not help following
to look on, when the mob proceeded with
the flour down to the river. They stood on the
outskirts of the crowd, watching sack after sack
as, with hoarse shouts, it was heaved into the
water so as to make the heaviest splash possible.
A new amusement presently occurred to some of
the leaders; that of testing the political opinions
of the passers by by the judgment they should
pronounce on the quality of the flour. Those
who declared it good must, of course, be parasites
of the court; those who made mouths at it were
the friends of the people; and the moment this
point was settled, every gazer from a distance
was hauled to the water’s edge to undergo the
test; every approaching carriage was waylaid
and stopped, and its inmates brought on the
shoulders of the mob. Of course, all gave
judgment on the same side;—a thing likely to
happen without much dishonesty, when the raw
flour was crammed into the mouth by foul and
sometimes bloody hands. It would have been
difficult to pronounce it very good under such
circumstances of administration.</p>

<p class='c001'>Among the most piteous looking of those
under test was the marquis de Thou, who was
taken from a non-descript sort of carriage, on his
way, as he vowed, to the duke of Orleans, but
certainly attended by more than one servant of
the royal household. While prosecuting his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.91'>91</span>explanations with gesture and grimace, uplifted
as he was above the crowd, he looked so like a
monkey riding a bear that a universal shout of
mockery arose. He was lowered for a moment,
out of sight; and the laugh rose louder than
ever when he reappeared, held at arms’ length
by a hundred hands, powdered all over like a
miller. His position made the judgment he had
to give all the more difficult, for it enabled him
to perceive the royal servants watching him on
one side, the duke of Orleans and some of his
fiercest followers on another, and the pitiless mob
around.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ah! it is very, very good food for the
poor, without doubt,” he declared, while in full
view of the court party, and with his mouth
stuffed with a compound which had just been
taken from a puddle underfoot. “Very fine
nourishment for a good king to buy dear, and
give away to a hungry people.—Ah! no more,—no
more, I pray you! I shall presently dine, and
it is enough. I cannot praise it more than I
have done.—Ah! but” (seeing the duke frowning)
“I do not say but it may be a little sour,—and
somewhat bitter,—yes, O yes, and gritty,—and,
O do not murder me, and I will also say
hurtful.—And poisonous? Yes, no doubt it is
poisonous,—clearly poisonous.—But, how bountiful
of the king to think of how the poor should
be fed!”</p>

<p class='c001'>The marquis might think himself fortunate in
getting off with a ducking in the yeasty flood,
into which he was let down astride on a flour
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.92'>92</span>sack. While sneaking away through the crowd,
after shaking his dripping queue, and drawing a
long breath, he encountered Charles, whom he
immediately recognised, and with inconsiderate
selfishness, exposed to the notice of the crowd
by his appeal.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ah, my friend, here is a condition I am in!
For our old friendship’s sake,—for the sake of
our vicinity in Guienne, aid me!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Do not answer him. Take no notice,”
whispered Maigrot from behind; “’tis as much
as your life is worth.”</p>

<p class='c001'>But Charles could not be inhuman. He gave
the old man his arm to conduct him to the carriage
which he intended to order to his own
house. Before he had well turned his back,
however, a piercing shriek from Julien made
him look round. The mob were about to carry
the boy towards the sacks.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Do not be alarmed, my dear,” said he.
“Taste the flour, and say whether you think it
good; and I will come to you in a moment to do
the same.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Julien shrieked no more, but he looked ruefully
in his father’s face, when Charles returned.
As soon as he had gulped down his share and
could speak, he said he had never tasted raw
flour before, but it was not so good as the hot
cakes that were made of it sometimes.—The boy
escaped with being only laughed at.—His father’s
turn came next.</p>

<p class='c001'>Charles stipulated, when laid hold of, to be allowed
to feed himself, and refused laughingly to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.93'>93</span>taste what came out of the puddle till his neighbours
should have separated the mud from the
flour. With a very oracular look, he then proceeded
from sack to sack, tasting and pronouncing,
apparently unmoved by the speculations he
heard going on all round him as to whether he
was a royalist from about the court, or a spy
from Versailles, or only an ignorant stranger
from the provinces. When he had apparently
made up his mind, he began a sort of conversation
with those nearest to him, which he exalted
by degrees into a speech.</p>

<p class='c001'>“When I,” he observed, “I, the very first,
opened a prisoner’s cell in the Bastille——”</p>

<p class='c001'>He was interrupted by loud cheers from all
who heard; and this drew the attention of more.</p>

<p class='c001'>“——I found,” continued Charles, “a mess
of wholesome food in that horrible place. Every
other kind of poison was there,—the poison of
damps and a close atmosphere; the poison of
inactivity which brings on disease and death; the
poison of cruelty by which all the kindly feelings
are turned into bitterness in the soul of the
oppressed; and the poison of hopelessness, by
which the currents of life are chilled, and the
heart of the captive is sunk within him till he
dies. All these poisons we found in every cell;
but to all their inmates was denied that quicker
poison which would have been welcome to end
their woes. Some, we know, have lived thirty-five
years under this slow death, while a very
small mixture of drugs with their bread would
have released them in fewer hours. That this
quicker method was ever used, we have no proof;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.94'>94</span>that it was not used in the case of those whom
we released, we know, not by their state of
health alone; for that, alas! was not to be
boasted of;—but by the experience of some of
us. When we were heated with toil and choked
with dust, we drank the draughts which the
prisoners left untasted in their cells. When a
way was made among the ruins, women came to
see what a work their husbands had achieved;
and when their children craved food, rather than
return home before all was finished, they gave
their little ones the bread which the captives had
loathed. Many thus ate and drank; and I
appeal to you whether any evil came of that day;
whether the sleep of the next night was not
sound as became the rest which succeeds to an
heroic effort. No one was poisoned with the
food then provided by the government; and yet
that horrible dungeon was the place, if there be
any, for poison to do its work. And if not attempted
there, will it be here? Here, where
there are a million of eyes on the watch to detect
treasons against the people? Here, where there
are hundreds of thousands of defenders of the
public safety? No, fellow citizens: this is not
the kind of treason which is meditated against
us. There are none that dare practise so directly
on your lives. But there is a treason no less
fatal, though more disguised, which is even at
this moment in operation against you. You ask
me two questions;—whether this food is of
a bad quality; and whether you are not half-starved;
and both these evils you ascribe to
your rulers.—To the first I answer, that this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.95'>95</span>food is, to the best of my judgment, good; and,
whether good or bad, that the government has
nothing to do with it, since it forms no part of
the stores that the king has bought up for
distribution. It is flour of the same harvest,
the same field, the same mill, the same bin,
that I and mine have been supplied from; and
it has nourished me well for the work I
have had to do; for letting in the light of
day upon the foulest dungeon that ever deformed
the earth,—for watching over those who
have been released from it,—for attending to the
proceedings of the Assembly,—for meditating
by night and consulting by day how the rights
of the people may best be attained and secured.
Keep the same food to strengthen you for the
same purposes. Do not forget your other complaint;—that
you are starving: and remember
that however much this may be owing to the misrule
and courtly extravagance you denounce, the
grievance will not be removed by your feeding
the fishes with that which your children are
craving. I spoke of another kind of treason
than that which you suspect, and I see about me
too many tokens of its existence;—the treason
which would not poison but starve you.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Of the motives of this treason I have nothing
to say, for I am wholly ignorant of them. I
only insist that there can be no truly patriotic
aim under the project of depriving you of the
food which is at best but scantily supplied. Do
you find in the most plentiful seasons that we
have corn enough to make sport with in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.96'>96</span>river? Are your houses even then so filled with
grain that, after feeding your children and domestic
animals, you have enough left for the
eels of the Seine? Is it to give you this over-supply
that the peasantry of the provinces live
under roofs of rushes, and couch upon beds of
straw? Tell me,—is there in the happiest of
times such a superfluity that no Frenchman has
a want or wish for more?”</p>

<p class='c001'>Furious cries of denial rose from all sides,
joined with curses upon the government which
year by year, by its extravagance, snatched the
hard-earned bread from the labourer’s hands.</p>

<p class='c001'>“This is all true,” replied Charles, “and is
in course of being reformed: but when did even
a tyrannical government inflict upon you such
evils as you are this day inflicting upon yourselves?
When has it robbed the shops of one
of the most useful class of men among you, and
carried away boat-loads of the food for which
thousands are pining, and destroyed your means
of life before your eyes? A worse enemy than
even a weak king and a licentious court is
making sport of your miseries, and overwhelming
you with such as cannot be repaired. Yes! let
it not hurt your pride to hear of woes that
cannot be repaired; for even the power of the
sovereign people is not unlimited, great as you
have proved it to be. You have abolished
servile parliaments, and obtained a virtuous assembly
of representatives. You have swept
away the stronghold of oppression, and can
tread with free steps the turf from which its very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.97'>97</span>foundations have been extracted. You have
rejected a constitution which was an insufficient
warrant for your liberties, and are in the way to
obtain universal assent to that noble Declaration
of Rights which shall become the social contract
of every civilized nation.—All these things, and
others which would have been called impossibilities
ten years ago, you have achieved. But
there are impossibilities remaining which more
truly deserve the name. You cannot prevent
multitudes dying when famine is in the land;
you cannot call up a new harvest before the seed
has sprouted; you cannot insist upon supplies
from other lands which are already drained.
You can waste your resources, but you cannot
recall them. With however much pride or levity
you may at this hour fling away the staff of your
life, you cannot retard the day when you will
sink for want of it,—when you will kneel in the
mud by the brink of this very current, and crave
the waters to give up what you have buried in
them, or to drown your miseries with your life.—Will
you suffer yourselves thus to be made
sport of? Will you permit yourselves to be
goaded into madness, in order that you may be
ready for madmen’s deeds? Will you throw
away what is in your own hands, that others
may reduce you to crave the small pittance
which will remain in theirs? Those who have
incited you to the deeds of this day take very
good care that all our granaries shall not be
emptied. They reserve a few, that you may at
length,—when all their schemes are ripe,—be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.98'>98</span>their tools through your literal <a id='corr98.1'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='dependance'>dependence</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_98.1'><ins class='correction'>dependence</ins></a></span> on
them for bread.—Disappoint this plot as far as
you can. It is now too late to keep plenty in
your own hands; but baffle the approaches of
famine to the last moment; for with hunger
comes slavery; or, if you will not have slavery,
death; and in either case, your country must
surrender your services at the very moment
when she wants them most.—Where is the
patriotism of bringing things to this pass?—Where
also is the justice of condemning unheard
so useful a class of men as those from whom
you have taken their property without accusation,
and, in many cases, their lives, on nothing better
than suspicion of their having communicated
with the court?—We must respect rights, as
well as frame a Declaration of them. We must
cherish the innocent and useful of society, if we
wish to restrain those who are neither the one
nor the other. Let there be a contrast between
the oppressors and the friends of the people.
Let tyrants tremble, while industrious citizens
dwell in peace.”</p>

<p class='c001'>It was now easy to wind up the discourse to
the point contemplated. Charles proposed that
Maigrot should be permitted, under proper
guardianship, to bake a provision of loaves out
of this very flour; and if they proved good, that
all that remained of his property should be
restored to him. The crowd rather relished the
idea of waiting the operation, in full prospect of
a batch of hot rolls gratis as the result, and the
proposal was received with acclamations.—Charles
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.99'>99</span>immediately singled out Maigrot, as he
stood on the outskirts of the mob, requested him
to lead the way homewards, put a loaf into each
arm of his little son, swung a sack of flour on
his own shoulders, and headed the most singular
of all the extraordinary processions which attracted
the gaze of Paris in those times.</p>

<p class='c001'>The duke of Orleans made no opposition.
He saw that the game was up for this day, and
departed in an opposite direction, having no
particular wish to hear the verdict which he
knew would be passed upon the bread, or to
witness the exultation of the baker.—Before
night, Maigrot not only felt his head safe upon
his shoulders, but was the most eminent baker in
Paris; and, if he had but had any flour remaining,
might have boasted such a business as he
had till now never thought of aspiring to.</p>

<hr class='c015'>

<h3 id='ch3.7' class='c020'><span class='sc'>Chapter VII.</span><br> <br> MOB SOVEREIGNTY.</h3>

<p class='c017'>The endeavours of individuals like Charles to
make the people wise were of little avail, however
successful at the moment, in opposition to
influences of a different character which were
perpetually at work upon the mob of Paris. The
obstinacy of the king in refusing to sign the
declaration of rights, the imbecility of the
ministry, the arts and clamours of the leaders of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.100'>100</span>different parties, and, above all, the destitution
of which they took advantage, overcame all principles
of subordination, all sentiments of loyalty,
and filled the people with a rage which rendered
them as blind to their own interests as unjust
towards those of the ranks above them. Riot
and waste spread and grew from day to day, and
the wise saw no more prospect of relief than the
foolish of danger.</p>

<p class='c001'>The king had been told, on the day the Bastille
was taken, that his capital was in a state of
revolution; but, nearly three months afterwards,
he was still wondering what the event might
mean; talking over with the queen the kindnesses
he had always intended showing to his
people, and assuring the people’s parliament that
the best thing he could do for them was to preserve
his dignity and prerogative. He could still
at Versailles ride abroad unmolested in the mornings,
feast his body-guard in the middle of the
day, and look on while the ladies of the court
were dancing in the evening, and sleep the whole
night without hearing the drums and larums
which kept all Paris awake; and could not therefore
believe that all would not come right, when
the people should have been persuaded of the
atrocious unreasonableness of the Declaration
they wanted him to sign. When he heard that
they drowned their flour in hatred of him, he
did all he could think of in ordering that more
should be given them; and when the queen discovered
that which every one would have kept
from her,—that she was hated,—she curled her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.101'>101</span>proud lip, and reared her graceful head, and
thought that the citizens must be ignorant indeed
if they fancied they could understand her springs
of action, or believed that they could intimidate
her. With the dauphin at her knee, she expatiated
to the ladies of her court on the misfortune
of kings and queens having any connexion at all
with the people beneath them, whom it was at
all times difficult to manage, and who might, as
now, cause serious trouble, and interfere materially
with the peace of royalty. She had at that
moment little idea how the peace of royalty was
to be invaded this very day.</p>

<p class='c001'>A murmur of horror and looks of dismay penetrated
even into the presence of her majesty,
when tidings arrived of the approach of an army
of women from Paris.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Of women!” cried the gouvernante of the
dauphin. “Is it because they can crave bread
with a shriller wail?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Of women!” exclaimed the lady Alice de
Thou. “They come to plead for the rights of
their children. I remember when they brought
the little ones in their arms after the storm, and
we gave them all we had.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Of women!” said the queen, thoughtfully.
Then, with fire in her eyes, she continued, looking
steadfastly on the trembling chamberlain who
brought the news, “Since they are women, it
is <em>my</em> head they want. Is it not so? Speak.
Are they not come for me?”</p>

<p class='c001'>As soon as the chamberlain could speak, he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.102'>102</span>muttered that he feared they were indeed not
women, but ruffians in disguise.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Aye, just so,” observed the queen. “Their
womanhood is emblematical; and the hint of
their purpose is not lost upon me. I hope they
are indeed men, and can handle arms. I would
take my death more willingly, being shot at as
a mark, than being torn to pieces by the foul
hands of the rabble. A death-blow from afar
rather than a touch from any one of them!”</p>

<p class='c001'>All present, except the chamberlain, were
loud in their protestations against the possibility
of any such danger. It was inconceivable; it
was barbarous; it was horrific; it was a thing
unheard of; in short, it was absolutely inconceivable.
The chamberlain mournfully admitted
that the whole was indeed inconceivable to all
who had not witnessed the procession, like a
troop of furies from the regions below, taking
their way through every savage district on the
earth, and swelling their ranks with all that
could be gathered up of hideous and corrupt.
That her majesty’s sacred person should fall into
such hands——</p>

<p class='c001'>All now began to urge flight, and the queen
was for a moment disposed to listen; but finding
that the king was out shooting, had been sent
for, and was expected every instant, she resolved
to wait his arrival, and then it was too late.
The poissardes, real and pretended, had by that
time rushed into the place, filled the streets,
stopped up the avenue, and taken up a position
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.103'>103</span>of control in the Chamber of Assembly. The
king reached the palace through a back entrance,
in safety, but it was in vain to think of leaving
it again.</p>

<p class='c001'>A hasty council was summoned, consisting of
the royal family, and a few confidential servants,
whose attachment to the persons of majesty
might set against the enervating terror which
had seized upon the ministers, and prevented
their exerting any influence over these new and
appalling circumstances. Within the circle,
rapid consultation went on in low voices, while
some kept watch at the doors. When discussing
the necessity of signing the declaration of rights,—which
was one of the demands of the mob
without,—the queen’s manner and tone were
perceived suddenly to change, and she appeared
to make light of the danger under which even
her spirit had quailed but just before.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Be careful;” she whispered to the person
next her. “There is a creature of the duke of
Orleans in the room. I wonder how he got in.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The lady Alice, who was watching her, followed
the glance of her eye, and saw that it
rested on one whom she little expected to see.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Madam!” she exclaimed, “it is my father!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes, my child; come to share your loyalty,
now that the women below have made him
afraid. If the palace is stormed, he must find a
refuge once more under the Orleans provision-carts,
which are, I suppose, in waiting, as usual.
We must give him no news to carry; and Alice,
as soon as he is gone, I must have your head-dress
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.104'>104</span>to wear, as the best protection while your
father points the way to us. I would not, however,
be so cruel, my child, as to deck you with
mine. You would lose your pretty head in a
trice, and then the marquis would altogether
go from us. It is through you that we are still
favoured with his countenance occasionally.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Alice’s tearful eyes had besought mercy for
her parent long before the queen seemed disposed
to yield it. While the adherence of the noblesse
to the royal cause was regarded as a matter of
course, and therefore not rewarded with extraordinary
gratitude, all symptoms of halting or
defection were observed with scorn, and commented
on without reserve by the haughty woman
who regarded her rank and empire as natural,
instead of conventional, and would as soon have
dreamed of being denied the use of her limbs
and senses as the privileges of royalty.</p>

<p class='c001'>It was through her influence that the king
refused to sign the declaration till the last moment,—when
he was compelled to do so at a
tremendous sacrifice of regal dignity;—at the
bidding, namely, of twelve poissardes who forced
their way into the presence with the deputies from
the Assembly, and under the compulsion of
threats of what might be expected from the army
of eighteen thousand men who had marched
from Paris during the afternoon, under the
enforced command of Lafayette.</p>

<p class='c001'>Never was anything beheld more dreary than
the aspect, more disgusting than the incidents
of this day and night. The skies frowned upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.105'>105</span>the scene, and wind and rain added to the difficulty
of what was achieved, and the horror of
what was witnessed. The deputies and their
attendants, the poissardes, appeared in the king’s
presence, covered with mud and drenched with
rain; the House of Assembly was crowded with
women, who came in for shelter, taking their
seats among the members, now eating and drinking,
and now lifting up an outcry to drown the
voice of an unpopular deputy; the fires of the
bivouacs in the streets were quenched with torrents
of rain, again and again, and the peaceable
inhabitants were in fear of being compelled
at length to throw open their gates to the rabble.
The leading figure of the mob, however, had
a peculiar reason for disliking the weather, as he
took care to show everybody. He was a gaunt-looking
ruffian, with a high pointed cap, and
grotesque garb, well armed, but especially
proud of an axe which he carried, ready for immediate
use at the slightest hint from the leaders
of the mob. With all his fear,—the only fear
he seemed capable of,—that it should be rusted
with the wet, and he thus delayed in his vocation,
he could not refrain from brandishing it
over his head, and displaying it in sight of the
sentinels, and such of the body-guards as looked
out now and then from the palace. This ruffian
took his stand immediately under the king’s
window, prepared a cannon as a convenient
block, and waited impatiently for victims. He
could not be persuaded to quit his post for
shelter; but he did once step aside for brandy.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.106'>106</span>On his return, he found two poissardes sitting
astride on his cannon, face to face, tossing off
their drams, and devouring the rations which
their prompting demon had taken care to provide.
The executioner warned them off, and
prevailed by the offer of a better seat within five
minutes. A hint was enough to show them his
meaning. He just pointed towards an approaching
group, consisting of an unfortunate soldier
with whom some of the mob had picked a quarrel
as he was going to his post for the night,—and
his captors. The victim looked dogged.
He saw the cold metal block on which the axe
was presently to ring his death-stroke: he saw
the fidgetty executioner, and the fierce women,
gathering round, munching their suppers as if
his life-blood was the draught they looked for to
wash down the last mouthful: he saw that no
help was within reach or call. He saw all this,
and seemed disposed to take quietly, though sullenly,
what was inevitable. He stood firm while
they pulled off his stock; he moved forwards
when they pushed him; he kneeled when they
pressed upon his shoulders; but some impatience
in their manner of doing so excited his passions
in a moment to their utmost strength. Before
they could keep him down, he was not only on
his feet again, but bounding high in the air,
grappling with the executioner for the axe,
kicking, trampling, buffeting all who laid hands
on him, and creating a hubbub which brought
the king to the window above, and conveyed to
the senses of the ladies a knowledge of what was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.107'>107</span>passing. It was a short struggle; but a struggle
it was to the last, and force alone could subdue
the victim. One virago clutched the hair of his
head, and others held down his feet. When his
blood flowed on the ground, and mixed with the
puddles of rain, one or two stooped down to see
how the eyes rolled and the nostrils yet quivered,
while, on the other side the block, the executioner,
mindful of his promise, tossed the headless
body to a little distance, so that his friends
might sit on it to finish their meal. What are
the invisible issues of life there was no one present
to think, during the whole scene, unless the
victim himself might have been conscious of his
thoughts darting that way; but such was the
visible issue of a life which a stupendous and
delicate natural apparatus had been appointed
to create, sustain, and develop. It had originated
in the deepest passions of human nature; been
maintained by appliances, both natural and
moral, which the keenest powers can barely recognize,
and not estimate; and developed for
objects of which man has only the remotest ken.
Such was the visible issue of this mighty series
of operations. That the handy work of Providence
should ever have been thus crushed, and
its mysteries thus boldly made sport of, may in
time appear as incredible as it would now seem
that children had ever been encouraged to pull
planets from their spheres in mockery, and
quench the milky way,—supposing such power
to have been left in their hands. In the latter
case, who would be answerable for the profanation?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.108'>108</span>Surely those who taught mockery in the
place of reverence. Who then was answerable
in the former case? Those who made the perpetrators
ignorant through oppression, and savage
by misrule. The responsibilities of a certain
order through many centuries were called to
judgment during the brief period before us; and
the sentence of condemnation not only went
forth on the four winds to the farthest corners of
the globe, but shall be repeated down to those
remote ages when it shall be forgotten on earth,
though recorded in heaven, that man ever shed
the blood of man.</p>

<p class='c001'>One or two more such murders on the cannon
and at the palace gates had not the effect of
alarming the court or the really patriotic leaders
of the people so far as to keep them on the
watch through the night. The king believed
that all was safe when he had given the signature
which it was the professed object of the expedition
to obtain. The queen was assured by
Lafayette that the people were wearied, and that
nothing was to be apprehended till morning;
and the general himself reposed in his hotel in
full confidence of the security of all parties. All
were not, however, thus satisfied. Some of the
deputies refused to withdraw from their chamber;
and while all was sleep and silence in the palace,
except where some watchful ear caught the soft
tread of the sentinels in the corridors, and the
pattering of the rain without, and at intervals,
some tidings from the passing gust, of revelry
in the streets,—while armed ruffians sang their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.109'>109</span>songs, or snored in their dreams round the watch-fires
where the shrill-voiced poissardes were
broiling their rations, or heating their strong
liquors,—a few of the wiser deputies sat, each
in his place, with folded arms, and in perfect
silence, while the light of a single lamp fell on
their uncovered heads and thoughtful countenances,
and foresight was invisibly presenting to
each pictures of that which was about to befall
their monarchy and themselves. Revellers,
legislators, and sentinels were not the only ones
who watched. One or two, who did not partake
the general’s confidence in the people thus
strangely congregated, wandered from watch-fire
to watch-fire, and about the precincts of the
palace, to be in readiness to warn Lafayette of
the first symptoms of movement.</p>

<p class='c001'>Among these was Charles, whose anxiety had
been awakened by the aspect of Paris after the
departure of the army for Versailles. It was
well known that Lafayette’s generalship on this
occasion was enforced; and not all the apparatus
of triumph amidst which the troops marched out,—not
all the drumming, and military music, and
display of flags amidst the rain, and echo of shouting
heard above the strong winds, could remove
the impression of the hollowness of all this rejoicing,—the
desperation of this defiance. When
the sights and sounds were gone, a deep gloom
settled down upon Paris. The shops were shut,
the streets were silent, except where the waggons,
laden with meat, bread, and brandy, converged
towards the Versailles road, or where groups of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.110'>110</span>two or three observers whispered their anticipations
to each other, mindful of none but
political storms, and questioning only whether
the sun of royalty would not this night have
a crimson setting, to rise upon their state no
more.</p>

<p class='c001'>Charles had been among these observers, and
the tidings he brought home made his wife
anxious to depart from this revolutionary city,
and take refuge in their country possessions.
She would be ready to go at any moment, she
declared, and when would there be so favourable
a time as when the place was half emptied of its
inhabitants, the police otherwise engaged than
in watching the proceedings of private individuals,
and all fear at an end of any attack upon the
wine-stores? Charles was half disposed to listen
to the scheme, though his views of what was
likely to happen differed as widely from his
wife’s as the prevailing tone of mind by which
they were influenced. Marguerite feared the
worst: her husband hoped all might yet be well,
and thought it, at all events, a good thing that
something decided must arise out of the present
crisis. He determined to follow the march to
Versailles, and to return as soon as he could
anticipate the event, to bid Marguerite stay and
make herself easy, or to carry her, her father and
children into Guienne. While she was packing
up the few necessaries she meant to take with
her, and persuading all the household but herself
to go early to rest, Charles was reconnoitring
the proceedings of such as were preparing a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.111'>111</span>terrible retribution for those under whose tyranny
they had suffered.</p>

<p class='c001'>He was no spy; being devoted to no party,
and acting for his own honest purposes; and he
therefore used no concealment. He conversed
with the riotous poissardes on public injuries,
conferred with the deputies on public order, and
exchanged a few words with the sentinels on the
probability of an attack on the palace in the
morning. The horrible threats breathed over
the fires against the queen, the brutal exultation
which appeared through mysterious and slang
expressions respecting the royal household, made
him wonder at the apparent defencelessness of
the palace. He was by no means satisfied that
all was safe till morning, and said so to a little
muffled up man whom he found standing in the
shadow, close by the great iron gates. He
could not make out whether this man was a
mere looker on, like himself, or a watch appointed
by either party.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Is it your own choice to be out to-night,
sir; or are you occupying a post? Because, in
the first case I would direct you where you
might see more of the state of things than here;
and, in the other, I would strongly recommend
your appealing to the general for support.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Alas! yes. I am sent hither,” replied the
quavering voice of the muffled up person.
“None would willingly be abroad this night,
and all my desire is to be left unobserved in this
shadow at present;—unless, indeed, some friend
should pass who might protect me, and from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.112'>112</span>whom I might learn that which I am sent to
ascertain.—You seem, sir, to be an orderly,
honest man. Can you tell me whether the
duke,—whether Orleans is at hand?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Orleans being the most honest and orderly
of men, hey, marquis?” said Charles, laughing.
“So you are sent out by lady Alice for tidings,
and you wait here for them till Orleans passes
by—Is it not so?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ah! what can I do? These canaille will
smother me again with flour, or drag me to the
cold cannon;” and here the little man shivered,
and his teeth chattered. “Do but bring me to
Orleans, my good sir, or get me a re-entrance
into the palace, and I will——I will——This
morning air is so raw! and I am——I am——not
fit for enterprise.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Charles fully agreed with him; but having no
interest to get a royal spy housed before his
errand was done, he could only tell him that, to
the best of his belief, Orleans was lingering about
the road between Versailles and Paris, or hanging
somewhere on the outskirts of the encampment
to witness the issue, without being implicated.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ah! how he is happy in comparison with
me!” cried the poor marquis. “I have never,
sir, meddled with politics——”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Further than as all the noblesse have operated,”
interrupted Charles. “I mean in
stimulating the people to meddle with politics.
You have wrought at second hand, marquis,
hitherto. Now is your time for taking your
part finally, and acting in it.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_3.113'>113</span>“Alas! what evils come of any one interfering
in such affairs but ministers and deputies!
Let them act, and let us be neutral.
This is all I ask.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Aye, but, marquis, it is too late to ask this;
because there has been great mistake about
what is, and what is not, being neutral. I dare
say you believed yourself neutral when you lay
sleeping in bed, while your peasantry were
keeping the frogs quiet in your ponds. I dare
say you had no thought of politics in your boar
hunts, or when three fathers of families were
sent to the galleys for alarming the lady Alice’s
brooding doves. Yet you were all the while——”</p>

<p class='c001'>The marquis’s light blue eyes were now seen
by the lamp light to be opened upon Charles
with such an expression of vacant wonderment
that it was plain there was no use in proceeding.
He evidently had yet to learn the true province
of politics; and, for his part, he thought the
merchant must have drunk a little too deep in
his own wine, to be talking of peasants and
pigeons in connexion with an insurrection in
Paris.—He would never have had courage to
leave his nook by himself; but now that he had
met a face that he knew, it required more courage
to remain there by himself, and he therefore
hooked Charles by the arm, and said he would
be wholly guided by him. Charles would rather
have dispensed with his attachment, but could
not shake off the old man into darkness and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.114'>114</span>helplessness, if he himself preferred venturing
into the light of the watch-fires, and upon the
threshold of Lafayette’s lodging, whither he was
warned he would be conveyed.</p>

<p class='c001'>If the marquis had carried a bold front,
nothing would have happened to him, any more
than to his companion; but his slouched hat,
halting gait, and shrinking deportment at once
drew attention upon him. The consequence was
that he heard double the number of threats, and
imprecations ten times more horrid than had
met Charles’s ears before. If he had now
regained entrance into the palace, he could have
told that which would have made even the
queen’s fiery blood run cold, and have given the
whole household a foretaste of worse horrors
than even those of the ensuing day.</p>

<p class='c001'>When they had arrived at the last of the line
of fires, the marquis believed his purgatory to be
nearly over, and indulged himself in a few ejaculations
of thankfulness on the occasion. He
was overheard, seized, dragged to the light, his
coat torn open, and his hat pushed back. The
queue looked suspicious; the manner of speech,
mixed up, as even these people could perceive,
of high breeding and imbecility, gave assurance
that he was a court adherent; to which there
was to be opposed only his own and Charles’s
assurance that he was a companion and friend
of Orleans. The knot of drinkers hesitated
whether to cut off his head or let him go, and
the marquis stood panting with open lips and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.115'>115</span>closed teeth, when an amiable creature, partly
masculine in her attire, and wholly so in her
address, proposed a half measure.</p>

<p class='c001'>“If he is one of them,” she observed, “we
shall find him again in the palace presently; so
let us mark him.”</p>

<p class='c001'>With the word, she seized the poor man’s
nose with the left hand, a burning stick with the
right, and branded his forehead with a cross;
then pushed him away, and turned to Charles,
offering to drink to him in his own liquor, the
choicest in Paris, if Orleans said true. She
pointed at the same time to a waggon near, on
which, to his amazement, Charles saw piled
wine-casks with his own mark, and brandy-bottles
sealed with his own seal.</p>

<p class='c001'>Perceiving at a glance that his cellars must
have been forced since he left home, and that all
further resistance would be useless, he determined
to yield to his wife’s desire to quit Paris;
and he hastened to discharge his duty of rousing
and warning the general, before turning his
back on this scene of disorder.</p>

<p class='c001'>Lafayette was up in a moment, and, though
still trusting in the peaceable disposition of the
people, dressed himself hastily, that he might be
among them by daybreak. Before he could
leave his hotel, however, warning sounds came
from the direction of the palace, and messengers
succeeded one another rapidly, stating that an
attack was being made on the great iron gates,
that blood had already been shed, and that the lives
of the whole royal family seemed to be at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.116'>116</span>people’s mercy. The general threw himself
upon a horse which happened to be standing
saddled below, and galloped off, before Charles
could recommend the marquis de Thou to his
protection, should he happen to find him in the
hands of the populace. His own anxiety to get
home was such as ill to brook any delay, and to
admit little other interest of any kind; but
chance threw him once more in the path of the
old man.</p>

<p class='c001'>As he was making the best of his way towards
the Paris road, stemming the tide of people that
was rushing towards the palace, he was suddenly
jostled and thrown down by an impulse in the
contrary direction. Nor was he the only one.
Many were bruised, some trampled, while a fugitive
burst through the throng, followed by a
knot of pursuers, who overthrew all that came in
their way, while their mingled curses and laughter
contrasted strangely with the panting cry of
the pursued. Some cried out that it was the
king; others uttered imprecations against him
as one of the hated guards; while Charles saw,
amidst his tattered, scared, and helpless condition,
that it was no other than the poor marquis.
His desperation gave the hunted man strength
to clear the mob, and to fly some way beyond,
till he reached the trees of the avenue, where
there was an end of his safety unless some better
aid was brought him than his own failing strength.
His enemies dogged him, surrounded him;—some
brandishing pitchforks, others large knives,
and not a few firing off their muskets to give a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.117'>117</span>new impulse to his terror. This sight was intolerable
to Charles, who saw in such cruelty
none of the palliations which he had admitted in
the case of some former acts of violence. Forgetting
all but what was before his eyes, he
snatched a pike, threw himself in front of the
pursuit, reached the victim just as he fell exhausted
at the foot of a tree, and stood astride
over him, with one hand in an attitude of defence,
while the other beckoned to the people to
listen. He shouted amid the din, and the few
words which were heard by those nearest to him
served his purpose of diverting their thoughts
from immediate murder. He told them that, in
the name of the marquis’s tenantry, he demanded
that the marquis should be placed in the
custody of the Assembly of deputies, to answer
for an infringement of the new laws by which
the property of the peasantry was protected.
He told them that the general was gone to the
palace, to mediate between the queen and the
poissardes, and as it would be a pity that those
who heard him should be absent from so interesting
a spectacle, he and one or two more
would take charge of the criminal, and convey
him before the sitting deputies. A well-timed
roll of the drums and discharge of musketry confirmed
his appeal, and drew away his auditors,
so that in a few moments, when the last lingerers
had gratified themselves with pricking their
victim a little with the points of their various
weapons, Charles found himself alone with the
almost lifeless old man.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_3.118'>118</span>On hearing that his further existence probably
depended on his reaching the assembly while the
mob was engaged elsewhere, the marquis made
an effort to rise and walk, and found himself so
much less hurt than frightened that he accomplished
the transit with small difficulty. Such a
deplorable object was never before presented to
the Assembly, at least under the title of a marquis.
He had scarcely a shred of clothing
under the soldier’s cloak which Charles had borrowed
from a sentinel at the door. His powdered
hair was dripping with rain, and his face
smeared with blood. He wept bitterly; murmuring,
in the tones of a woman, his wonder as
to what he could have ever done to offend the
people, and how the world could have grown so
cruel and ungrateful. The Assembly had little
leisure at this time, and were glad to accept
Charles’s offer of conveying the prisoner away,
and his guarantee that the marquis should set
out for his estate in the provinces without delay,
and not return till the troubles of the capital
were at an end. The marquis was little disposed
to make opposition.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Take me away,” he said, “though I only
fly from one doom to another. You say my
tenants are enraged against me; and I say that
they will drink my blood. The vile are sovereigns
in these days, and the noble have the
knife at their throats from day to day. O, if
they had killed me under the tree, it would have
been over; but now it is still to come. O save
me! Do not leave me! Make me your servant.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.119'>119</span>Employ me as you will; but do not let them
kill me!”</p>

<p class='c001'>Charles recommended that the old man should
in fact travel into Guienne as his servant, and
take possession of his chateau or not, according
to the apparent disposition of the peasantry when
they should arrive.—Not a moment was to be
lost in proceeding to Paris, if the departure of
the family was to take place while the populace
and the troops were engaged at Versailles, and
the whole attention of the magistracy was directed
upon what was passing there.</p>

<p class='c001'>An empty cart was found in which to stow the
marquis, while his protector walked by its side.
They left behind them the most fearful spectacles
of that day,—the murder of some of the guards,
the narrow escape of the queen, the brutal joy
of the mob at the enforced consent of the royal
family to be conveyed to Paris, and the beginning
of that dreadful march itself, as anomalous,
as disgusting, as any spectacle that was ever presented
as a pageant. But, one circumstance
which signalized that march, they were also witnesses
to. Half-way between Versailles and
Paris, on a mound planted with trees, a figure
was seen, moving behind the stems, and peeping
forth at every sound of wheels or footsteps. It
was Orleans, who had stationed himself here to
watch the issue of his plot,—the return of the
expedition, with the bodies of his royal cousins,
dead or alive.</p>

<p class='c001'>With some difficulty, he was persuaded to come
down and speak to his humble servant the marquis;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.120'>120</span>and when he did greet him, it was with
something very like a smile at his crest-fallen
appearance, and querulous complainings.</p>

<p class='c001'>“My good friend, these are strange times,”
he observed. “I should think your valet has
hardly had time to attend to you this morning.
However, you will find plenty unoccupied at
Paris to renew your powder.—O, you wish to go
at once, and shoot on your own territory. Well;
perhaps you are wise, since our kind of shooting
here is not exactly to your taste. You must
take care, however; for I hear that more bullets
fly from behind the hedges there than in the
open fields. Farewell, my dear sir, for I see
your companion is impatient. He wants to be
keeping guard over his wine-cellars. I wish
him an ample fortune out of the wines therein
contained at this moment.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Charles’s impatience was not only on account
of his own affairs. He distrusted Orleans so far
as to be vexed that the marquis whispered to him
their plan of escape. There was no particular
sign of interest in the duke’s countenance at the
relation; and it only remained to be hoped that
no harm would come of this unnecessary confidence.
The marquis was far from thinking it
unnecessary, as a word from the duke would
procure passports for the whole family. This
word Orleans was prevailed upon to write, and
furnished with it, the marquis poured out his
gratitude more vehemently than, but a few
months before, he would have supposed possible;
and then bade his vehicle proceed, watching from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.121'>121</span>a distance how the duke once more passed the
enclosure, and took his station among the trees
as before.</p>

<p class='c001'>The cellars were found to be indeed more than
half emptied; and of the casks that remained, one
or two were staved, to drown the gunpowder
and other combustibles. No attack had been
made upon the house, and Marguerite had sufficiently
got the better of her terrors, to be ready
for immediate departure. No obstacle arose,
and Steele, with Pierre under him, consented to
remain in charge of the property till Charles
could return, after having deposited his family in
security.</p>

<p class='c001'>The marquis made a rather singular-looking
valet, with a manner alternating between superciliousness
and awkward deference,—a strutting
gait when he forgot what he was about, and a
cringing one when he happened to cast a glance
upon his dress. He passed muster very well,
however, as a battered old soldier turned valet;
his strut passing for regimental paces, and his
cringe being ascribed to the honourable wounds
he was supposed to bear. M. Raucourt took off
the attention of all who might be disposed to
make remarks, by telling everybody that he was
going to see his olive groves. The party travelled
with more speed than the dismal procession
from Versailles; so that before the
royal family was mournfully ushered into the
Hotel de Ville at dusk, Charles and his household
were some leagues on their journey southwards.</p>

  <h3 id='ch3.8' class='c020'><span class='sc'>Chapter VIII.</span><br> <br> UPSHOT OF FEUDALISM.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c017'>The hopeful disposition of both Charles and
Antoine was remarkable at all times, and in
whatever society they were. When they were
together, it became well nigh excessive, and occasioned
no little amusement to their friends in
happy times, and much sighing from the apprehensive
Marguerite in such evil days as they
were now fallen upon. Each excited the other
to perceive bright specks on the dark horizon,
and neither would lag behind the other in discerning
cause for encouragement, and in pointing
out that, as good had issued from apparent
evil in some former analogous instance, it would
be a sin to doubt that the same thing might happen
again. Marguerite was almost offended that,
while she looked tremblingly around as the
dancing waters of the Garonne first flashed upon
their sight under the gleam of an October sun,
her husband encouraged the joyous gestures of
the children standing on his knee, and burst out
singing one of the popular provincial airs to
which the banks of that river so often echo.
But when Antoine came forth to meet them as
they alighted, in high spirits, though he had actually
nothing good to tell them, however disposed
to hope for everything blissful, Marguerite
turned from him to her father, as the most reasonable
personage of the two.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_3.123'>123</span>Antoine was beginning a laugh at his brother’s
first choice of the luxury of a valet, but checked
himself instantly on hearing who it was, and
wherefore.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Do you suppose he may safely dress himself,
and appear to arrive at his chateau to-morrow?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Why, scarcely yet, perhaps,” replied Antoine,
gravely. “The peasantry are in an uncomfortable,
irascible state, and the poor man
would hardly have fair play among them; but
it cannot last long, and then we shall have him
trampling our crops again as solemnly as ever;
perched, like a wax figure, on horseback, and
utterly unable to comprehend such a thing as a
curse against himself; or to bestow a thought
as to whose ground he is trespassing upon.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Let us hope he has learned more consideration
by his misfortunes,” said Charles. “At any
rate, he may yet learn it by using his eyes and
ears in the interval between this hour and his
restoration to his honours and privileges,—which
I suppose will happen by the time he has
learned to tie his own queue according to his
own fancy. Meanwhile, how is Favorite?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“O, our beauty! She has rather languished
this season; but she will be all the more brilliant
next year; for two bad seasons give a pretty
fair security that the third will be good. It is
as if the steam of blood had come from your city,
Charles, like a blight, and shrivelled her swelling
fruit. The crisis is come, you say. There will
soon be no more blood, and wine will gush
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.124'>124</span>instead. Yes, yes, next season all will be
well.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But our peasant neighbours, Antoine. Has
their condition improved as you were confident
it would?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“How should it yet? The time is not come.
They have not yet got over the scarcity of last
year. But the woodcocks will soon be here;
and the lady Alice’s doves multiply all the faster
now they are left to themselves; and in the
spring, there will be a greater resource of cattle,
and of their milk; and the bad seasons have not
destroyed our fish. We are planning to get
larger and larger supplies from Bordeaux, as well
as to send out more boats upon the river.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Corn is too dear, at present, I suppose, for
the poor, if indeed you have enough for the rich?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“We are all somewhat better off in that respect
than we were; but a great part of the discontent
arises from the incessant changes in the
value of whatever we get to eat, as long as the
supply is turned out of its usual course. When
we can no longer depend on an article whose
supply is usually pretty regular, and its price
not very variable, we are subject to a perpetual
rise and fall which we cannot calculate, and
which brings disappointments to the people
which they are ill able to bear.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“How do you mean? I thought our poor
helped out their subsistence by nettle broth and
frog stew; and for these, I suppose, they pay
neither labour nor money?”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_3.125'>125</span>“No; but they must have something in addition.
Presently it will be woodcocks—the most uncertain
article of food that can be. If there should
be a fine flight of them to be had for the killing,
labour will become cheaper to us capitalists,
while the labourers will be better rewarded: that
is, it will cost us less to feed our labourers, while
they will get more food for an equal quantity of
labour. This, while it lasts, lessens the cost of
production, and if it went on a whole year, would
cheapen our corn considerably next harvest. But
the resource lasts a very short time, and the reduction
of the price of corn, therefore, is only of
that temporary kind which proceeds from a relaxation
of demand. Before the people well
understand how this is, the cattle begin to come
in from the woods,—more numerous than ever,
from so much arable land having, since the storm,
yielded a kind of rude pasture. This is a somewhat
less uncertain resource than the woodcocks,
and lowers the value of corn for a longer period.
What I want, to fill up the intervals of these
uncertain supplies, is a permanent provision of
fish.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“How strangely the values of things are
turned topsy-turvy!” exclaimed Charles. “Time
was when our peasantry would no more have
thought of dining off woodcocks than I of giving
my servants a daily dessert of pine-apples.
Dainty game of that sort is commonly thought
to rise in value with the progress of improvement.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And so it does; and that it now exchanges
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.126'>126</span>for less either of money or bread, than the commonest
sorts of meat did three years ago, is a
proof that our condition has gone back instead
of improving. It is a proof that the produce
of our toil is scantier than it was; that the produce
which we cannot command—that which comes
and goes without our will and pleasure—exchanges
for less when there are more to demand
it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“We may say the same of cattle.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Just at present; because our cattle is for the
most part wild, having got abroad into the woods
at the time of the hurricane. But when we have
collected our flocks and herds again, and can
attend to their breeding, so as to proportion the
supply to the demand, we shall find their value
permanently depend, like that of the crops with
which they will then be fed, on the cost of production.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Of course, if they feed on crops grown for
their use. At present, when they pasture themselves
on land which would otherwise lie waste,
they are cheap when there happens to be, a sufficient
supply of fish and woodcocks, because
there is little cost of production;—no rent, little
capital, and less labour. Any sudden rise of
value proceeds from a temporary increase of demand.
It is to equalize the demand for butcher’s
meat, that I and some of my neighbours want
to procure a regular supply of fish.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yet fish is an article whose value rises with
the progress of improvement. It must do so in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.127'>127</span>proportion as more labour is required to procure
an equal supply for an extended market. As
years pass on, Antoine, we shall have to fit out
more boats for the river, and to build them larger,
and man them better, as we have to send them
out farther. But then there will be more of
other things to give in exchange for fish.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“True; but at present we cannot give our
fishermen what they think a fair premium upon
their cost of production, because our cost of production,
the cost of the labour we give in exchange,
is extraordinarily high.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Do they complain of the price you give?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Very much, but that cannot be helped. We
complained of their <em>social price</em> in old days,—of
having to pay, not only the profits and wages
necessary to procure the article, but the market
dues, which were very oppressive. They answered
that they did not pocket the dues, and
could not help the high price. Now they complain
that (the dues being lately remitted) they
cannot even secure their <em>natural price</em>,—that is,
a reasonable profit in addition to the cost of the
labour.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“If they cannot do this, why do they supply
you? They will not surely go on furnishing the
market with fish at prime cost.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Certainly not, for any length of time; but,
till the woodcocks come, they must submit to
wear out their boats a little, without an equivalent,
looking forward to the time when we may
again afford them a fair market price,—which
will, by that time, be a money price; for then we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.128'>128</span>shall be able to get out of our present inconvenient
state of barter, and the coin which has
disappeared will have found its way back.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Meanwhile, the people, you say, are discontented
as much at the fluctuations in their
affairs as at their absolute want of many comforts.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes; we hear perpetual complaints that no
man can now calculate how much his labour is
worth. So many hours’ work will one week
bring him two good meals, and at another, not
half an one. If they go into the woods for
game, so many head may to-day exchange for a
coat,—to-morrow for a house.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Much of this hap-hazard must also be
owing to the uncertainty of public affairs. If we
could but foresee whether we really have arrived
at the crisis,—whether trade will probably flow
into its natural channels again after a certain
fixed period, our condition would immediately
improve. There is no other such effectual
regulator of price as clear anticipation, because
it enables us to calculate the ultimate cost of
production, on which exchangeable value finally
depends.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Antoine observed, in a low voice, that the
most suffering of his poor neighbours had lately
begun to indulge in a new sort of anticipation.
They had been told,—and nobody was aware
whence the report arose, that there was a room
full of coin in the chateau of the marquis de
Thou. Their own coin had somehow gone
away from them, and they fancied that, if they
could but get any instead of it, all their woes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.129'>129</span>would immediately cease. Antoine had reason
to believe that the chateau would soon be
attacked, unless some means of undeceiving the
poor creatures could be discovered.</p>

<p class='c001'>The brothers comforted themselves, according
to their wont, that such means could not fail
soon to present themselves. It was impossible
that so gross an error could long subsist. Their
confidence did not make them the less watchful
to aid the enlightenment of the people around
them; for their hopefulness was of that kind
which stimulates instead of superseding exertion.
La Favorite experienced this; for, amidst all
their hopes of what her beauty would be next
year, they toiled to repair her losses and renovate
her vegetative forces. Charles could not
have brought himself to return to Paris till this
was done, even if he had been satisfied to leave
Marguerite in charge of the marquis.</p>

<p class='c001'>This gentleman chose soon to free the family
from his presence, against their advice; even
in the face of their strong remonstrances. Like
many who are deficient in physical courage and
mental strength, he was rash and obstinate. As
soon as he had recovered from his astonishment
at not being killed on the day of his arrival, he
began to be certain that there was no further
danger, and, blind to the manifold tokens of his
extreme unpopularity, which might have greeted
his senses and understanding at any hour of any
day, he determined on secretly quitting his disguise,
without troubling his kind friends to reason
any further with him. One morning, accordingly,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.130'>130</span>his valet’s dress was found on the floor
of his chamber, and on his table, a note of
ample, though haughty thanks to his preservers;
and by noon, the marquis’s old steed, bearing
a rider whose skirts, blue eyes, and entire
deportment could not be mistaken, was seen to
trample new ploughed fields, and give promise
of riding over heedless children, as before.</p>

<p class='c001'>The last thing that entered the old man’s
head was altering his modes of procedure in any
one respect. He could not escort lady Alice,
because she was not there; but he paced the
terrace, in an afternoon, with his head half
turned, as if he saw her ghost beside him. He
could not lead a long train of hunters, because
some of them were in Austria, some in England,
and one or two already laid headless in a bloody
grave; but he galloped forth on the same
routes, making the most of the two or three
servants who followed him still, and returning
in state to sit solitary at the head of a long
table, and toast his own loyal sentiments. What
was worse,—he trampled his poor neighbours
when they came in his way, and overlooked
them when they did not, as if he had never been
branded by a poissarde, or hunted in the avenue
at Versailles.</p>

<p class='c001'>All this, it may be supposed, soon came to
an end,—and by means which proved the error
of the popular belief about the chamber full of
gold at the chateau. Out of pure humanity,
Charles repeatedly vanquished his resentment at
the marquis’s supercilious treatment of him, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.131'>131</span>offered warnings of the blackening gloom which
settled in the faces of the peasantry when the
little great man came in sight; but the marquis
had got it into his head that Charles had an
interest in frightening him. He thought he
had been more frightened than most men already,
and wisely determined to be so no more.
He bowed, laid his hand on his heart, disengaged
his rein from the friendly grasp, and passed on.</p>

<p class='c001'>“My hopefulness is nothing to his, Marguerite,
after all,” observed Charles. “You
say I hope against hope. He hopes against
reason. The difference is that the one hope
will vanish when most wanted, and the other, I
trust, never wear out.”</p>

<p class='c001'>One night, when there was no moon,—one of
the longest winter nights,—no moon was wanted
for a space of some miles on the banks of the
Garonne. Instead of the boats sailing black in
the silver beam, they passed crimson in the fiery
glare. The sheeted snow glittered and sparkled
as if it had been noon instead of midnight:
the groves dropped their melted burden, and stood
stiff and stark in wintry bareness, stripped of
the feathery lightness in which they had risen
against the evening sky. Cries which ill beseem
the hour of sleep roused the night-birds, and
volumes of red smoke spread themselves abroad
to eclipse the stars. Charles’s steps were
directed towards the chateau before he had
received any notice, but from his own apprehensions,
whence the fire proceeded which had
scared his children from their beds. He arrived
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.132'>132</span>in the court-yard,—not in time to save the marquis,
but to speak with him once more.</p>

<p class='c001'>The old man was bound to the balustrade of
his own terrace; and an executioner stood beside
him with an upraised and gleaming sword. His
appearance was much what it had been on a
nearly similar occasion before. He attempted
to spring forward, and a gleam of hope shot across
his countenance when the brothers appeared: but
there was a something in their faces which checked
the emotion, and his jaw dropped once more.</p>

<p class='c001'>All efforts, all stratagems were vain. The
people declared themselves unpitying to tyrants,
and resolved to do away with despotism in their
quarter of the land, in like manner with their
brethren in Paris. Five minutes for preparation
was all they would allow, and even Charles at
length despaired of further favour. He approached
the victim with a calm and serious
countenance. The old man looked up.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Is there no hope?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“There is always hope. Let us hope that in
another state we shall better know how to love
and forgive one another. Here, we have a poor
understanding of this; but even here we can
forgive. They will not now forgive you; but
you will leave them that which will make them
do so hereafter. Leave them your pardon.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“O, Alice,—my daughter! Not if they
murder Alice.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“They shall not. I promise you——”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But I did not expect this,” uttered the
shivering prisoner. “I went to bed——”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_3.133'>133</span>“Then collect yourself now. A few minutes’
resolution.—One effort at calmness——”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But is there no hope?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“None whatever. Settle your mind to your
fate. There is only misery in struggling against
it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I will. I will. Only stay by me.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“What a confidence for such a moment!”
thought Charles, as he saw the tractable expression
which the countenance assumed. It was
some comfort, however, that there was any
confidence which could give decency to his dying
deportment.</p>

<p class='c001'>The people around grew impatient. The executioner
lifted his sword. The victim looked up
at it, half fearfully, half meekly, like a penitent
child at the impending rod. He fell, without a
sign or a cry; and at the moment, the flames
burst forth from the lower windows, as if to lick
up, in as summary a vengeance as they had been
guilty of, the perpetrators of this murder. All
rushed from the terrace, with a yell of consternation,
leaving the body alone, its unclosed eyes
shining in the glare, as if gazing unmoved on
that violence which could no longer reach it in
the shape of injury.—When the gust fell, and
the flames retired some space, the ruffian who
held the sword returned to the place of execution,
severed the head, tossed the body into the flames,
and returned with his trophy to the cheering mob.</p>

<p class='c001'>There was nothing for Charles and Antoine
to stay for. They could neither save property,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.134'>134</span>nor prevent crime. There was no purpose to be
answered by an attempt to do the first; for the
lady Alice could never return hither, or probably
find any corner of her native land in which to
dwell in peace. Any endeavour to check the
people’s rage would only have brought on more
murders. It was better that they should occupy
themselves with destroying inanimate things
than have their wrath directed upon human objects.
The brothers therefore left them endeavouring
to discover the treasure-chamber, and
paced silently homewards, trying whether, after
such a spectacle as this, their hopefulness could
get the better of their heart-sickness.</p>

<hr class='c015'>

<h3 id='ch3.9' class='c020'><span class='sc'>Chapter IX.</span><br> <br> ADJUSTMENT.</h3>

<p class='c027'>Marguerite began to think that she and her
family had better have staid in Paris, since violence
as foul as any there, with less chance of
redress, took place in the country. But as there
were fewer marked for destruction in a thinly
peopled than in a crowded district, the work of
horror was sooner over; and within a few weeks,
all was quiet around her dwelling. No judicial
inquiry whatever was made into the fate of the
marquis; and night after night, ominous gleams
were seen from afar, marking where life and property
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.135'>135</span>were being offered up in expiation of
former tyranny. When every neighbouring
chateau that was empty had been sealed up and
guarded by the people from being entered by its
owners; and when every inhabited one had been
dismantled or converted into a pile of blackened
ruins, there was a truce. The gentry sighed
over the abolition of feudalism; the peasantry
gloried in the destruction of the aristocracy; and
both, looking no farther than their own borders,
supposed that all was over, and the state of the
country,—miserable as it was,—settled.</p>

<p class='c001'>Charles and his brother knew too well what
was passing in Paris to acquiesce in this belief;
but they were glad of the good effects it seemed
to produce in quieting the minds, and therefore
fixing the outward circumstances of their neighbours.
People went about their regular business
once more, prices grew steady in the markets, and
the mysterious, dishonest sort of bargaining
which had gone on immediately after the destruction
of the chateaux, was seen no more.
No golden timepieces now passed from hand to
hand, in exchange for the coarsest articles of
clothing or furniture; and if polished tables, or
morsels of curious old china were seen here and
there in the hovels of half-starved peasants, they
were not put up for sale, and did not answer
the purpose of further perplexing the values of
things. Seeing that Marguerite began to feel
pretty much at her ease once more, going to rest
without presentiments of being roused by fire,
and venturing, with only the children, to transact
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.136'>136</span>her necessary purchases among the peasantry,
Charles began to try whether he could make
anything of his business at Paris; and set out,
in order that he might be on the spot to take
advantage of the first symptoms of tranquillity to
meet the demand which would then certainly arise.</p>

<p class='c001'>He went to Paris before winter was quite
over; and found more promise of a settlement
of public affairs than at any time since the commencement
of the revolution. Yet he would not
hear of his family joining him, till it should be
known whether or not king, parliament, and
people would cordially agree in the new constitution
which was then in preparation. When
there was not only a promise of this, but all arts
and artificers were actually put in requisition to
render the spectacle of taking the oath as magnificent
as the occasion required, there was no
further pretence for Charles’s prudence to interfere
with the hopefulness which now seemed
rational enough. He sent a summons to Marguerite
to return and witness the festival from
which her loyalty and his patriotism might derive
equal gratification. But Marguerite was
detained in the country by her father’s illness,—his
last; and the children were deprived of the
power of saying afterwards that they had witnessed
in Paris the transactions of that day which
was regarded at the time as the most remarkable
in the annals of France.</p>

<p class='c001'>That day, the 14th of July, 1790, was appointed
to be a high festival throughout the
kingdom: Charles passed it in the Champ de
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.137'>137</span>Mars; Marguerite by the dying bed of her father;
the children, under the guardianship of
their uncle Antoine, among the rejoicing peasantry;
and Steele, who had returned to Bordeaux
when Charles settled himself again in Paris,
took the opportunity of visiting La Haute Favorite
for the first time after so many vicissitudes.</p>

<p class='c001'>It seemed to them all a strange,—to the superstitious
among them, an ominous circumstance
that they should be thus separated on the occasion
when all were called upon to recognize the
social agreement under which they and their
successors were to live.</p>

<p class='c001'>A gleam of the afternoon sun shone in upon
the face of Marguerite’s father as he dozed, and
made him turn restlessly on his couch. His
daughter hastened to shut it out, and the movement
awoke him.</p>

<p class='c001'>“One is fit only for the grave,” he said,
“when the light which shines on all above it
becomes painful.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Father! you are better,” said Marguerite,
turning round astonished.</p>

<p class='c001'>“No,” said he, faintly, “not better. I cannot
bear this light,—or this heat,—or—but no
matter; it will presently be over. But where is
Charles?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“He will be here very soon; but it is only
two days since you became worse; and there
has been no time for him to come yet. To-day
he is waiting upon the king, and next he will
wait on you.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“On the king!” and the old man was roused
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.138'>138</span>at once. “And all the people? I fancied they
had left off their duty. Who waits upon the
king?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“The whole nation,” Marguerite replied,
sighing to herself, however, over her own view
of the matter—that the king was, in fact, waiting
upon the nation. She proceeded to tell what
was doing in Paris, and remarked that she hoped
they had finer weather there than here, where it
had been a day of continued rain, till the gleam
came which had wakened her father.</p>

<p class='c001'>M. Raucourt was too ignorant of the events of
the last two years to be able to comprehend the
present proceeding. He could not see what the
people had to do with the constitution; but laid
the blame on his own weak brain, when assured
that the loyal men of France were all consenting
to the measure. Other tokens of ignorance were
much more affecting to his daughter. He wished
to be raised in bed, so that he might see his
olive woods in the evening glow. They were
no longer there, and his attention must be diverted
to something else. He wished to behold
the marquis de Thou passing the house for his
daily ride.—The bones of him he asked for were
mouldering under the ruins of his own abode.—“At
least,” said M. Raucourt, “let me be carried
to the window, that I may see the chateau.
It looks so finely on the terrace! and it is so
long since I saw it!”—Grass was growing on
its hearths, and the peasants’ children were playing
hide and seek among its roofless halls.</p>

<p class='c001'>“You have not asked for the children,” said
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.139'>139</span>Marguerite. “If you are so strong this afternoon,
perhaps you can bear to speak to them.”
And they were sent for, and presently made
their appearance from the river-side, full of
what they had been seeing and doing. They
told how one cannon was fired when the hour
struck at which the royal procession was to set
out, and another when the whole array was to be
formed in the Champ de Mars, and others to
represent the taking of the oath by the king,
by the representatives of the parliament, and by
Lafayette in the name of the people.</p>

<p class='c001'>“And what is all this for?” asked the old
man. “It is a beautiful spectacle, no doubt;
but there were no such things in my time as
the king and the people swearing at the same
altar.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“The people make the king swear, and some
of them do not think he likes it,”—observed
Julien, unmindful of his mother’s signs. Pauline
went on,</p>

<p class='c001'>“No more than he liked being brought prisoner
from Versailles, and having his guards’
heads cut off.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The little girl was terrified at the effect of her
words. She in vain attempted to make up for
them by saying that the king and queen were
very well now; and that the people did not
expect to be starved any more, and that everybody
was to be very happy after this day. The
loyal old man said he should never be happy
any more; and groaned and wept himself into
a state of exhaustion from which he did not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.140'>140</span>revive, though he lived two or three days
longer.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I wish,—I wish—” sobbed poor Pauline,
“that the people had never meddled with the
king——”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Or the king with the people,” said Julien,
“for that was the beginning of it all.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I am sure so do I,” said Marguerite, sighing.
“It is little comfort to say, as Antoine does,
that the world cannot roll on without crushing
somebody.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“If that somebody puts himself in the way,
uncle said,” observed Julien.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Everybody has been in the way, I think,
my dear. All France is crushed.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Not quite, mamma. Uncle Antoine and
Mr. Steele are sitting between the two big vines,
and they say that everybody will be buying wine
now that buying and selling are going to begin
again.”</p>

<p class='c001'>It was very true that the young men were
enjoying their favourite retreat to the utmost;
gilding it with the sunshine of their expectations,
and making it as musical with the voice of hope
as with the gay songs which were wafted from
the revellers below.</p>

<p class='c001'>They were not a little pleased when their
anticipations were countenanced by a letter from
Charles which reached his wife on the day of
her father’s death, and was not the less in
accordance with her feelings for having been
written before tidings of the old man’s illness
had reached Paris, and being, as usual, hopeful
and happy.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_3.141'>141</span>“I have written to Antoine,” he said, “to
urge all care in the approaching vintage, and all
dispatch in the management of our immediate
business. Good days are coming at last, unless
despotism should bring on itself a new punishment,
and rouse once more the spirit of faction,
which has been laid to rest this day by that
powerful spell, the voice of a united nation. It
would astonish you to see how commercial confidence
has already revived; and, as a consequence,
how the values of all things are
becoming fixed; and, again, as a consequence
of this, how the intercourses of society are
facilitated, and its peace promoted. It was the
perception and anticipation of this which to me
constituted the chief pleasure of the magnificent
solemnity of this day. It was a grand thing to
behold the national altar in the midst of an
amphitheatre filled with countless thousands;
but it was a grander to remember that these
thousands were only the representatives of multitudes
more who were on tiptoe on all our hills,
in all our valleys, watching and listening for the
token that they may trust one another once
more, and exchange, for their mutual good, the
fruits of their toil. It was touching to see the
battalion of children,—‘the hope of the nation,’—coming
forward to remind the state that it
sways the fate of a future age; but it was
more touching to think of our own little ones,
and to believe that, by the present act, the
reward of the social virtues we try to teach them
is secured to them.—It was imposing to see one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.142'>142</span>golden flood of light gush from a parting cloud,
giving an aspect of blessing to what had before
been stormy; but it was as an analogy that it
struck us all, and impelled us to send up a shout
like the homage of worshippers of the sun. Has
not a light broken through the dreariness of our
political tempests? There maybe,—let us hope
there will be, from this day, order in the elements
of our social state. Let but all preserve the faith
they have sworn, and there will be no more sporting
with life and property, no absurd playing with
baubles while there is a craving for bread, no
ruin to the industrious, and sudden wealth to
such as speculate on national distress. We
may once more estimate the labour of our peasantry,
and the value of our own resources, and
fix and receive the due reward of each. We
may reach that high point of national prosperity
in which the ascertainment and due recompense
of industry involve each other; when the values
of things become calculable, and mutual confidence
has a solid basis.—I do not say that this
prosperity will come, but I hope it will; and if
all others have the same hope, it certainly will.
It may be that the sovereign will lose his confidence,
and go back. It may be that the parliament
or the people will do the same; and
then may follow worse miseries than we have
yet known. But if they see how much social
confidence has to do with social prosperity, they
will refuse to disturb the tranquillity which has
been this day established.</p>

<p class='c001'>“And now, however you may sigh or smile a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.143'>143</span>the spirit of hope which is in me and Antoine,
what say you to it in the case of a nation? Are
not its commercial exchanges a most important
branch of its intercourses? Must not those exchanges
be regulated by some principle of value,
instead of being the sport of caprice? Is not
that principle the due and equable recompense
of labour, or (in business-like terms) the cost
of production? Is not this recompense secured
by the natural workings of interests—and can
these interests work naturally without an anticipation
of recompense—that is, without hope,
inspiring confidence? Depend upon it, hope is
not only the indispensable stimulus of individual
action, but the elastic pressure by which society
is surrounded and held together. Great is the
crime of those who injure it; and especially
heinous will be the first trespass on public confidence
of any who have been in the Champ de
Mars this day. As that which is national springs
from that which is individual, I will add that
Antoine and Steele are patriotic if they exult in
the ripening beauties of Favorite; and if you
would be patriotic too, gladden yourself with the
promise of our children, and tell me, when we
meet, that you trust with me that all will be well
both with our wines and our politics.”</p>

  <h3 class='c020'><i>Summary of Principles illustrated in this Volume.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c023'>There are two kinds of Value: value in use,
and value in exchange.</p>

<p class='c001'>Articles of the greatest value in use may have
none in exchange; as they may be enjoyed
without labour; and it is labour which confers
Exchangeable Value.</p>

<p class='c001'>This is not the less true for capital as well as
labour being employed in production; for capital
is hoarded labour.</p>

<p class='c001'>When equal quantities of any two articles require
an equal amount of labour to produce them,
they exchange exactly against one another. If
one requires more labour than the other, a
smaller quantity of the one exchanges against a
larger quantity of the other.</p>

<p class='c001'>If it were otherwise, no one would bestow a
larger quantity of labour for a less return; and
the article requiring the most labour would cease
to be produced.</p>

<p class='c001'>Exchangeable value, therefore, naturally depends
on cost of production.</p>

<p class='c001'>Naturally, but not universally; for there are
influences which cause temporary variations in
exchangeable value.</p>

<p class='c001'>These are, whatever circumstances affect
demand and supply.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_3.145'>145</span>But these can act only temporarily; because
the demand of any procurable article creates
supply; and the factitious value conferred by
scarcity soon has an end.</p>

<p class='c001'>When this end has arrived, cost of production
again determines exchangeable value.</p>

<p class='c001'>Its doing so may, therefore, stand as a general
rule.</p>

<p class='c001'>Though labour, immediate and hoarded, is the
<em>regulator</em>, it is not the <em>measure</em> of exchangeable
value: for the sufficient reason, that labour itself
is perpetually varying in quality and quantity,
from there being no fixed proportion between
immediate and hoarded labour.</p>

<p class='c001'>Since labour, the primary regulator, cannot
serve as a measure of exchangeable value, none
of the products of labour can serve as such a
measure.</p>

<p class='c001'>There is, therefore, no measure of exchangeable
value.</p>

<p class='c001'>Such a measure is not needed; as a due regulation
of the supply of labour, and the allowance
of free scope to the principle of competition
ensure sufficient stability of exchangeable value
for all practical purposes.</p>

<p class='c001'>In these requisites are included security of
property, and freedom of exchange, to which
political tranquillity and legislative impartiality
are essential.</p>

<p class='c001'>Price is the exponent of exchangeable value.</p>
